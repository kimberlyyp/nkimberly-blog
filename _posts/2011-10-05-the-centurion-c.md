**The Centurion C; News**
Previously managed by the San Diego Unified School District, University City High School’s Student Store has changed hands and is now the Centurion Corner run by our Associated Student Body, allowing all store profits to be directly used to fund student-related activities such as Homecoming.

The change was proposed by ASB and approved by Principal Jeff Olivero, so that the student body funding would be developed further. “Since it’s just ASB now, it’s all going to be for the student body. [the Centurion Corner] is going to solely benefit the students, your dances, your events. Think of it as a huge fundraising project that is year-long,” said ASB Member Estefannia Roacho.
“Everything is going to change about it. Not just its management,” said ASB President Sally Sa.  “We’re planning on repainting it and changing up the merchandise. Give it a new kick. It will be a new experience for all,” said Roacho.
“We’ve all been working on it at a good, strong pace and are close to finishing. An exact date hasn’t been determined at this time, however,” said Sa.
“The name was a group effort really. Centurion Corner is a bit snazzier than Student Store, which is too generic for school spirit and fundraising,” said Roacho.
“[It will be at] the same location... Next to Room 210,” said Roacho.
Around the campus, news of the change elicited various responses. Seniors Tammy Le and Trixie Nguyen didn’t like the name, suggesting that it should be instead named Centurion Square. “[It would roll] off the tongue better,” said Le. Others, however, found the acronym and modified versions of Centurion Corner catchy enough to merit its establishment. “The C-C has a cool ring to it. It’s catchy. I’ll see you at C-C, the Centurion C, the Centurion,” said Freshman Haram Pulido.
