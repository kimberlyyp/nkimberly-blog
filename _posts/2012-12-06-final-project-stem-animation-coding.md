****"For your final project, create Matlab program that displays a graphic scene that include objects that move in the scene. The scene should involve a scientific, engineering or technological topic. Some artistic flexibility will be allowed. For example, the trajectory of a buckyball that carbonman punts over a silicon surface might follow a parabolic trajectory, as would a macroscopic ball over a grass field, whereas the most important forces on a buckyball over a surface would not be gravity. In a case like that, add a notice somewhere on the image."**
