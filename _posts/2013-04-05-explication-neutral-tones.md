Neutral Tones
BY [THOMAS HARDY](http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/thomas-hardy)

We stood by a pond that winter day,
And the sun was white, as though chidden of God,
And a few leaves lay on the starving sod;
         – They had fallen from an ash, and were gray.
Your eyes on me were as eyes that rove
Over tedious riddles of years ago;
And some words played between us to and fro
         On which lost the more by our love.
The smile on your mouth was the deadest thing
Alive enough to have strength to die;
And a grin of bitterness swept thereby
         Like an ominous bird a-wing….
Since then, keen lessons that love deceives,
And wrings with wrong, have shaped to me
Your face, and the God curst sun, and a tree,
         And a pond edged with grayish leaves.

**Neutral Tones – Thomas hardy: An Explication**
Burning leaves are like dying embers, both doomed to ash. The imagery in “Neutral Tones” by Thomas Hardy tells of a lost love both sudden and unexplainable to the narrator. The poem begins and ends with corresponding descriptions of the speaker’s changed environment, highlighting the tragic loss the speaker incurred. The environment of the first stanza is described as of two people, pond, sun, God, and gray leaves. The imagery of leaves presented in this stanza is very ominous, depicting leaves “fallen from an ash, and were gray.” Leaves when burned, unlike coal, will not light a blazing and lively fire, but will already begin dying upon the first touch of flame. This sort of death at its start metaphor seems to be what our speaker is trying to allude to.

The second and third stanza collectively describes the shining and promising features of his love and the demise of those very features. The second stanza begins with his description of “eyes that rove,” ventured, over many riddles and conversed with young fiery spirit that ironically, soon died out with their love. The third stanza describes his love’s smile, one “alive enough to have strength to die.” He alludes to her sudden mood with this description, that she smiled with rapture but frowned with an ominous bitterness. Together, the second and third stanza portrays a love that was strong and vigorous but suddenly died to dull and bitterness. The suddenness with which he describes these transformations, “played between us to and fro / On which lost the more by our love,” “alive enough to have strength to die,” is symbolic of his own sudden lost love. This sudden pain our speaker describes gives meaning to the burning, already dying leaves mentioned before, ones that were dying from the start.
Finally, the last stanza, as mentioned before, is of a depiction of the environment, paralleling the first. The environment of the last stanza is described as of a lesson, a changed man, love’s face, God, sun, tree, pond, and gray leaves. When aligned with the environment of the first stanza, of two people, God, sun, pond, and gray leaves. We can see that what was once two people became  a changed man and a love’s face. We can find that what was once merely sun, pond, God, and gray leaves became sun, pond, God, gray leaves, and a tree with a lesson. It seems, then, that this poem has a very crucial biblical allusion. Honing in on the tree, we realize that the leaves had fallen because Hardy had grabbed an apple from the tree. He fell in love with a devil who at first was seductive in its temptation, but soon came to leave him in shambles and devastation. He has learned the lesson now, but at the cost of forever having sinned against God (creation of original sin). The leaves that were gray represent the work of the devil. The flashing flame at its first second, a seductive temptation, that soon dies to nothingness and loss.
Through this poem, Hardy also seems to describe  that either a woman is like the devil, or more frighteningly, that the devil is like a woman.
