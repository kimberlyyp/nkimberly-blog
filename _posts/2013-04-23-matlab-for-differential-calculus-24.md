My set of solutions to A2 – Visualizing Solutions to ODEs using DFIELD and PPLANE is available in pdf: [Week2–20D](http://nkimberly.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/week-2-20d-google-drive.pdf).

Content deals with MATLAB DFIELD (written by John C. Polkin), Initial Data Conditions, Zoom Functions, Newton's Law of Cooling, System of ODE's, MATLAB PPLANE (written by John C. Polkin), and Predator-Prey Systems.
*(Assignments and more resources for learning MATLAB can be found [here](http://www.math.ucsd.edu/~math20d/Spring/MatlabIndex.html).)*
