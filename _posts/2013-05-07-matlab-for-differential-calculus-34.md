My set of solutions to A3 – Numerical Methods with First Order Equations is available in pdf: [20D–A3](http://nkimberly.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/week-3-20d-google-drive.pdf).[
](http://nkimberly.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/week-2-20d-google-drive.pdf)

Content deals with two Numerical Methods: Euler's Formula and the Runge-Kutta Method. Learn to implement and experiment with Euler's formula and use MATLAB's built-in command "ode45" to access the more powerful Runge-Kutta Method.
*(Assignments and more resources for learning MATLAB can be found [here](http://www.math.ucsd.edu/~math20d/Spring/MatlabIndex.html).)*
