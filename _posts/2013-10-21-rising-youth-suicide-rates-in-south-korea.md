Rising Youth Suicide Rates in South Korea
**Introduction**
For those under the age of 40, suicide is the number one cause of death (South Korea - The Suicide Capital, 2013). The suicide rates of those 10 to 24 years of age in South Korea is at 9.4, while the average suicide rate for the same age range of nations within the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) is at 6.5 (Youth suicides in, 2013). The suicide rates of youth in South Korea is particularly alarming because as from 2001 to 2011, the number of suicides among youth in South Korea has increased by 57 percent, rising at a steeper rate than those of adults in South Korea (Youth suicides in, 2013). The rapid rise poses serious social concerns and necessitates investigation: what are the circumstances linked to the rise and general height of youth suicide rates in South Korea – and are these circumstances deeply rooted?

In this paper, an investigation will be conducted into the circumstances and sociological mechanisms surrounding the rise and general height of youth suicide rates in South Korea. The investigation will begin with a brief presentation of several student suicide cases and statement of apparent patterns among cases. Following, the paper will assess the culture and circumstances that influence South Korean society. Finally, sociological theories will be brought in to provide mechanism-based explanations for how these circumstances within South Korean society could have led to the rise and general height of youth suicide rates in South Korea.
**Cases & Analysis**
In 2008, a 10-year old student in Gwangju committed suicide (Schwartzman, 2008). The day before, the boy had cried publicly over his declining academic performance since his last midterm examination (Schwartzman, 2008). In 2011, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology suffered four instances of student suicide (Kim, 2011). Academic pressures is cited as the main cause (Kim, 2011). In the same year, 16-year old student in city of Mokpo set himself on fire in the public street (AFP, 2011). The note he left behind cited poor test scores and fear of disappointing his parents as his reasons (AFP, 2011).
These are several of the many cases of student suicide in South Korea. In 2012, 139 South Korean students committed suicide, with family conflict, depression, and exam stress as central triggers (AFP-JIJI, 2013). In general, fear of parental disappointment and feelings of academic inadequacy are traits shared among the majority of student suicide cases.
These patterns, however, do not explain why the rates are rising. For that, a glimpse at the ever-fierce competition may provide the answer. In 2011, Park Jae-Won, head of Seoul’s Visang Education Research Center, remarked, "Many parents push children to study at an increasingly earlier age regardless of their brain development ... even causing depression or attention deficit disorders as a result” (AFP, 2011). Competition that used to begin in high school now begins in elementary school. In 2013, the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) was cancelled nationwide for the first time on accounts of suspected cheating in South Korea (Wall Street Journal, 2013). The record magnitude of the SAT cheating scandal and remarks by Jae-Won indicate that competition within the nation has grown ever more fierce over the years.
Altogether, increasing competition, academic pressure, and fear of parental disappointment are qualities linked to the rise and general height of youth suicide rates in South Korea.
**The Role of Confucianism**
The South Korean culture is currently semi-Confucian, and it reflects clearly in the nation’s obsession with academic success (Wang, 2013). The imperial examination system in China was founded by the Confucian tenant of meritocracy (Bell, 2008, p. 14). Individuals had to pass a written examination to become a government officer, a position that brought wealth and honor to the individual’s entire family (Bell, 2008, p. 14).
The Confucian practice of equating academic success with social status has left behind a mindset of pouring everything into exams and marks. The practice is not only unidimensional in its measurement but also forceful in its influence on a family’s wealth and status. In these qualities, the practice is self-defeating: for one, a unidimensional goal cannot be achieved by everyone, and two, the pressure on families to push their children to achieve the narrowly-defined goal creates a level of strain that is much more than many individuals can bear.
**Strain Theory**
Strain Theory was founded by Emile Durkheim (2009), and developed for nearly a century by various other sociologists. Strain Theory is the study of how certain social structures may be pressuring its citizens into committing suicide (Review of the Roots, n.d.). “Strain” refers to the frustration motivated by the gap between desire and reality. The gap between unrealistic culturally-defined goal of top-scoring children and what the children are actually capable of cause strain within the young generation.
According to a poll by Credit Lyonnais Securities Asia, an independent brokerage and investment group, 100% of South Korean parents want their children to get into university. The stress is high: in another poll, one-fifth of South Korean students expressed desire to commit suicide. In 2009, there were 202 cases of student suicides. Kim Jieun, a university student, recalls her high school years, “I thought of emigrating. I hated the education system so much” (Exams in South Korea, 2011).
Strain, to iterate, is caused by the conflict between culturally defined goals and the institutionalized means available to achieve those goals (Review of the Roots, n.d.). Specifically, the dominant cultural goal for the youth of South Korea is to be in the top scoring percentile of exam marks. The message is that success and employment are equated with high scores, which is the measure of honor and wealth in a Confucian-based culture (Bell, 2008). The socially accepted institutionalized means of achieving these top-ranking scores is believed to be hard work and education, implying that people who apply themselves to study and work will succeed in acquiring both wealth and honor, and those who do not succeed are labeled as not working hard enough.
The problem exists in that, statistically speaking, not every student can be in the top 10, 100, 1000, or even 10000, especially considering that 97% of South Korea’s young adults complete high school, the highest percentage recorded in any country (Education at a Glance, 2012). No matter how hard-working and intellectually capable students can be, and how many hours every student in the student population of the country can put in, there will always be a statistic of 90% of students who are not in the top 10%. Thus the institutionalized means of working hard to achieve the culturally desired goal of being a top-scoring South Korean student is in conflict for an upwards 90% of South Korean students. As a consequence, strain is generated, necessitating coping strategies that the 90% must use to deal with the pressures that are brought to bear on them (Review of the Roots, n.d.). The five modes of coping strategies identified by Merton are conformity, innovation, retreatism, ritualism, and rebellion (Review of the Roots, n.d.). It is within the rebellion cluster that certain individuals substitute the goal of being top students with the desperate goal of ultimate escape from society.

The Coleman Boat Model titled Figure 1.1 explains how the conflict between South Korea’s culturally desired goals and institutionalized means of achieving the goal could lead to higher suicide rates among youth in the nation. The conflict between cultural goals and institutionalized means creates a situation in which most students are unable to reach the normative goal. The inability to reach these goals causes an internal strain with the students. Severely pressured by the system to be a top-scoring student, but often without possible ability to achieve the desire, students fall away from the goals and its means. This departure from conformity may manifest in cheating, crime against others, and even suicide. Thus according to Strain Theory, the social circumstances in South Korea seem to play a major role in the rising suicide rates of students.
**Playing the Game**
Surely, objections arise as to why young adults would allow for the Confucian-based society to run their modernized and competitive lives in the first place. Questions that may be posed include, why cannot the students rebel, and why do not the students simply ignore their authority figures, and make decisions more in alignment with realistic and personal goals?
First, there is a culture of filial piety embedded within the Confucian-based culture of South Korea. Filial piety defines the respect that children should show their parents. The idea of filial piety is pervasive: within the Chinese legal system, criminals are punished more severely if the crime was against a parent, and fathers exercised tremendous legal power over their children (Bell, 2008, p. 10). Second, every South Korean individual necessarily learns and plays the pre-existing game the individual is born into. According to George Herbert Mead (2009), the individuals in society are analogous to the players of a game: to enable social coordination, individuals must internalize the rules of their culture. This is to say, Confucian values are deeply rooted within every individual born and raised in South Korea.
[![Figure 1.2](http://nkimberly.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/screen-shot-2013-10-21-at-11-55-00-am.png?w=300)](http://nkimberly.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/screen-shot-2013-10-21-at-11-55-00-am.png)
In Figure 1.2, the Coleman Boat Model represents the breakdown of how a Confucian society keeps its members in conformity with its principles. The Confucian hierarchical culture is the pre-existing game. To enable coordination with society, individuals in society internalize the rules of the game: individuals learn to submit to their parents, among other authority figures and customs. The internalization leads children to behave in submission. The children then have become part of the game, and the Confucian hierarchy is maintained.
**Stratification May Alleviate Youth Suicide Rates in South Korea**
The highest three suicides per 100,000 people per year by countries are Greenland, 108.1, South Korea, 31.7, and Lithuania, 31.6 (Suicide rates per, n.d.). Noting the seasonal variations in suicide rates, researchers have blamed summer insomnia caused by incessant daylight for the majority of suicides in Greenland (Constant sunlight linked, 2009). In South Korea, the general reasons given are psychological despair, physical pain, economic difficulties, and family problems (Suicide in South Korea, n.d.).. Economically speaking, South Korea is fairing well as the 15th largest economy in the world (South Korea: Economy, n.d.). On the other hand, Lithuania cites the difficulties related to the prolonged economic crisis linked to the Russian Economic Crisis of 1998 (Pridemore, 2006).
As we see, there is no one set of social circumstances that correlates perfectly with the ranking of suicide rates in the world due to how vastly different the cultures of different countries are and the type of factors that pressures its kind of citizens. There are, however, clusters of countries that are similar in culture enough to detect the consistent factors linked to suicide rates. Because this paper investigates South Korea, cross reference should take place between countries of reliable similarity. Countries with cultures similar to South Korea would be China and Japan, whose cultures are also based strongly on Confucianism.
With South Korea, investigations pinpointed to the unidimensional academic standard and filial pressures, compounded by increasing competition, as lying at the heart of rising student suicide rates. China and Japan, countries also influenced by Confucian culture, display remarkably similar trends in suicide rates.
Like Korea, China’s number one cause of death for those under 40 is suicide (Dubois, 2013). As well, the causes cited among young people “has to do with education and family environment,” linking the suicide rates with the unidimensional education system and the filial piety obligations of Confucian-based culture (Wang, 2013). As in Korea, the suicide rates of youth in Japan have also been on the rise. According to the National Police Agency, the number of students who committed suicide in 2011 hit a record high of 1,029, 10.9 percent higher than the previous year (Yomiuri Shimbun, 2012). Of the students, 140 committed suicide due to academic underachievement and 136 due to worries about their job prospects (Yomiuri Shimbun, 2012).
Having linked the unidimensional education system, intense filial piety, and ever fierce competition to the rise in youth suicide rates, it may be sensible to explore whether stratifying the plane of success to multiple dimensions may alleviate the youth suicide rates in Confucian-based cultures, particularly that of South Korea.
Charles Pyo, a young internet entrepreneur, started a business helping people set up websites. His parents initially did not approve, but when they saw all of the revenue, they supported his endeavors. Mr. Pyo, who through interview made it into Yonsei, one of South Korea’s prestigious SKY schools, asserts, “Korea would be a happier place if more people had the courage to strike out on their own” (Exams in South Korea, 2011).
**Conclusion**
In this paper, an investigation was conducted into the social circumstances surrounding the rise in youth suicide rates in South Korea. The investigation began with a case analysis that identified the apparent patterns among student suicides. The patterns were then linked to Confucian principles, the guidelines of South Korean society. Assessing the Confucian principles through Strain Theory, an in-depth explanation for the link and mechanism between the Confucian-based culture of South Korea and the nation’s suicide rates was provided. Reaching out to Mead’s player-game theory, the paper answered the second part of our research question: indeed, the circumstances surrounding youth suicide rates in South Korea are deeply rooted within the nation. The theory provided an explanation as to why a culture can not simply change overnight, and that the pressures on the youth in South Korea can not be that easily removed.
Through the investigations, it became altogether apparent that the unidimensional education system, coupled with the pressures from filial piety and ever fierce competition, plays a major role in the rising suicide rates of youth in South Korea. Through this realization, an appeal to stratification of the definition of success was proposed. In a resolute conclusion, The Economist writes, “To remain what one writer called ‘The Land of Miracles’, Korea will have to loosen up, and allow many routes to success” (Exams in South Korea, 2011). Such a change would require large investments of time, initiative, and nationwide efforts, but as the suicide rates of youth go up – the desperate need for change, likewise.
