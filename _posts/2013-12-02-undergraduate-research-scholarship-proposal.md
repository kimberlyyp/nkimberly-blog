**Title of Project **

Improving YBaCuO thin film growth using pulsed laser deposition technique.

**Overview / Abstract of Project (92/100) **

For the summer, the goal is to grow a relatively large, high-quality single crystal YBCO for study of order parameter symmetry in the A-B plane. Through this summer research project, Oxide Nanoelectronics seeks to verify order parameter symmetry in the A-B plane through plane tunnel transport measurements. D-wave symmetry of HTS materials have been studied extensively, but these studies have only been through c-axis tunneling. We seek to measure the d-wave order symmetry in the A-B Plane. In this manner, we may better understand the physics behind these materials.

**Detailed Description of Project including a timeline of the project (366/1,000) **

Oxide Nanoelectronics has built and tested d-wave symmetry in plane through commercial thin-film YBCO. The results suggest that the curve characteristics are different in different directions. However, commercial films were polycrystalline and not uniform. Reliable results would require single crystal films to have definite proof of order parameter symmetry.  

We seek to reduce the significance of the probe size and the variances between measurements by growing large single-crystal YBCO. To grow this high quality single-crystal YBCO, a variant of Pulsed Laser Deposition using a modified off-axis deposition process will be used, since on-axis deposition results in films with defects from particles. To test the electrical quality of the film, I will test the chip using a four point van der Pauw method to obtain film’s basic properties which are resistance, critical temperature and residual resistivity. The crystallography of the film will be tested through x-ray diffraction to ensure that the grain will be size large enough. I will also calibrate the growth rate using a profilometer, a technique I learned at NANO3. The goal is to be able to grow single crystal films that are 30 nm or less, with grain sizes in the order of microns or greater. 

Variables that affect the growth of [Y](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yttrium)1[Ba](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barium)2[Cu](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copper)3[O](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen)7  (YBCO) in the ablation process are the pulsed laser energy density, geometrical arrangement of the sample holder, temperature of the substrate, and pressure of the growth gas. Temperature, pressure, and target stoichiometry must be precisely controlled to stabilize the superconducting phase. 

Throughout the summer, each of these parameters will be fixed and varied to ultimately obtain a high-quality, single crystal YBCO that is 30 nm or less in thickness and micron or greater in grain size. The first week I shall experiment with varying oxygen pressures and the second on substrate temperatures. Afterward, varying the geometric placement may lead to better crystallization. During the fourth and fifth week, we will characterize the film by examining transition temperatures, widths, and densities. The sixth week is to make process design adjustments as necessary, while the seventh week acts as a buffer in case process re-design faces road-blocks. The eighth week is reserved for producing a research paper regarding our study.
