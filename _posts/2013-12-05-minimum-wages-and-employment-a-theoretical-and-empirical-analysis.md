Minimum Wages and Employment: A Theoretical and Empirical Analysis
Introduction
Minimum wage is by definition the lowest wage at which workers may sell their labor (McDowell, 2012). It acts as a price floor with the intention of ensuring everyone makes a decent, livable wage. Currently, however, many people in the United States and even worldwide believe that a full-time minimum wage worker makes too little to provide a self-sufficient living, let alone for a family (Babones, 2012). Sharon Vassell, an office manager in Manhattan, where the minimum wage is $7.25, believes that even the proposed $9 minimum wage hike is too low. She remarks, "I think it should be more than $9. Nobody can live on $9. Maybe $12" (Minimum Wage: Too Low? Too High? Just Right?, 2013). However, David Neumark, an economist at the University of California, Irvine states, “The evidence is overwhelming that the minimum wage has reduced jobs among the people they are trying to help” (Lange, 2013). Thus the question is – will raising the minimum wage alleviate living conditions for those below poverty line, or will the disturbance in the market equilibrium incur counter-productive consequences? This paper seeks to investigate the two popular views on the minimum wage policy, the evidence supporting these views, and whether the policy is even well-suited to combat poverty in the first place.

**The Conventional View**
Conventional economics, as is widely accepted and taught in schools, weighs in heavily the importance of the market equilibrium. In Principles of Economics, it is explained in Chapter 6 that any policy which prevents a market from reaching equilibrium causes a reduction in total economic surplus (McDowell, 2012). Because the minimum wage is a price floor policy that prevents the market from reaching equilibrium, the laws of supply and demand reasons that minimum wage would cause a reduction in total economic surplus, leading to an inefficient market (McDowell, 2012).
The reproduction of Figure 13.8 from Principles of Economics presents a graph, where price runs along the y-axis and quantity runs along the x-axis. Wage is measured along the y-axis and quantity of job is measured along the x-axis (McDowell, 2012). The market equilibrium exists at the intersection of supply, people wanting to work, and demand, jobs available, from which equilibrium wage (W) and equilibrium number of jobs (L0) is gathered. Graphically, raising the equilibrium wage (W) to a higher, minimum wage (Wmin) leads to a decline in number of jobs available (L0 -> L1) and rise in number of jobs sought, leading to the surplus of labor we refer to as unemployment.
The re-productions of Figure 13.9 and Figure 13.10 from Principles of Economics depict the employer and worker surplus at market equilibrium and a minimum wage above equilibrium wage, respectively. Differences between the graphs exists in the level of worker surplus (shaded red), employer surplus (shaded blue), and the existence of deadweight loss (shaded yellow).
Figure 13.9 (re-produced)
Figure 13.10 (re-produced)
Under high minimum wage laws, there is a decline in employer surplus, a rise in worker surplus, and a rise in deadweight loss. Deadweight loss is a loss of economic efficiency that can occur when equilibrium for a good or service is not Pareto optimal. It is generally caused by monopoly pricing, externalities, price ceilings, and price floors, like the minimum wage. Altogether, a market with price floors that are above the equilibrium results in employers benefiting disproportionately less, workers (who still hold jobs) benefitting slightly more, and - as a result - an inefficient market. Theoretically, the loss on the employer’s behalf and general loss of economic efficiency would lead to employers cutting back and thus result in a rise in unemployment.
Critics of minimum wage hikes, such as Neumark, have been using this conventional textbook argument for years, that raising the price of labor would cause the demand for the labor to decrease and, consequently, cause a rise in unemployment (Neumark, 2002). The conventional approach reasons the consequences of minimum wage as counter-productive, since a decline in employment opportunities would mean that the minimum wage policy would only alleviate the financial conditions for those who would keep their job, but meanwhile take away from others, who would lose their jobs (Neumark, 2002).
**The Card & Krueger Study**
Advocates of minimum wage hikes, however, argue that the real world is not like the theoretical model described by textbooks. A popular study by David Card and Alan Krueger attests to this alleged disparity. The famous study is done on the employment effects of fast-food chains in New Jersey and Pennsylvania by the minimum wage hike from $4.25 to $5.05 per hour (Card, 1994). Employers were surveyed before and after the April 1992 minimum wage increase. Managers were asked for data on full time staff before April 1992 and again during November to December 1992 (Card, 1994). The finding refutes the textbook speculation: “Contrary to the central prediction of the textbook model of the minimum wage… We find no evidence that the rise in New Jersey’s minimum wage reduced employment at fast-food restaurants in the state” (Card, 1994).
Several explanations can back up Card and Krueger's study. The first is that the minimum wage hike was actually not significant. The rise in wages by less than a dollar amount actually kept the minimum wage close to the equilibrium point for low and unskilled workers. Thus, even without the minimum wage, the workers would have been paid relatively the same amount (Ehrenberg, 2012). However, according to this explanation, further hikes in minimum wage that would bring the price floor too far from the equilibrium wage is likely to lead to the conventional forecast of a rise in unemployment.
Another, and more popular, explanation is that the majority of employers who would be footing the minimum wage hike can afford to do so. According to an analysis of data from the Census Bureau, roughly two-thirds of low wage workers are employed by large companies with over 100 employees and not by small businesses (Big Business, Corporate Profits, and the Minimum Wage, 2012).
Third, paying a strong hourly wage may actually benefit businesses by improving employee retention. Chief Executive Officer of Costco, Craig Jelinek, in March 2013 explains, “We pay a starting hourly wage of $11.50 in all states where we do business, and we are still able to keep our overhead costs low. An important reason for the success of Costco’s business model is the attraction and retention of great employees. Instead of minimizing wages, we know it's a lot more profitable in the long term to minimize employee turnover and maximize employee productivity, commitment and loyalty" (Keener, 2013). Thus, according to Jelinek, higher wages may actually incentivize employees to stick around and be more productive, ultimately saving employers in the long-run.
**Worldwide Data**
In which case, the minimum wage hike should be supported, as it presents no adverse effects on employment. However, while the evidence for general employment at fast-food restaurants by the Card and Krueger points toward insignificant or unremarkable decline, consensus of studies from all over the world and throughout history does point toward a decline in employment, at least among teenagers and low-skilled workers. For example, Neumark has surveyed more than 100 academic papers and notes that the consensus remains that the minimum wage hikes have indeed hurt employment, particularly among teenagers and restaurant workers (Neumark, 2002). In addition, worldwide data gathered throughout history up to the present by the Global Labor University, depicted in Table 1, tells a similar story: there is significant trend of negative effects on employment of teenagers and low-skilled workers (Herr, 2009).
Thus we ask, is there even a consensus on the empirical consequences of minimum wage? And even if there is, is the consensus strong enough that the nation can confidently pursue further minimum wage hikes – or do the multitude of nuances make the policy too risky to pursue?
**Further Considerations**
An investigation needs to be made into who actually earns minimum wage. According to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Census Bureau, most minimum-wage earners are actually young, part-time workers and relatively few of which live below poverty line (Sherk, 2013). Indeed, the average family income of minimum-wage earners is over $53,000 a year (Sherk, 2013). Thus a hike in minimum wage raises wage and potentially lowers employment rates for suburban teenagers, not the working poor. Since the alleviation of poverty is foremost in consideration of the matter, it appears policy makers sought to look elsewhere for relief systems that would effectively target those below poverty line.
In addition, another problem remains that would discourage further minimum wage hikes. While minimum wage earners may be primarily composed of those not in poverty, and while some studies such as Card and Krueger’s show no adverse effects of a minimum wage hike, the minimum-wage hike may still affect a large majority of those in poverty in another way. Take the places that hire minimum wage workers – McDonalds, Walmart, and so forth – it is often these same places that supply to low-income families. Should these businesses decide to raise their prices in response to minimum wage hikes, the effect would be dangerous for the people who rely on the businesses’ low prices (Christina, 2013).
**The Earned Income Tax Credit Program**
With all of the nuance surrounding the speculative gains and costs of a minimum wage hike, and the equivocal evidence regarding consequences in employment rates, it appears far more sensible to seek alternative policies to alleviate the circumstance of the poor. For example, the current tax system does subsidize work by the poor through an earned income tax credit (EITC). A low income family with earned income gets a payment from the government that supplements its wages. The system works by providing an EITC equal to some rate (14% in 1990) of earned income for earned income within an initial stage value, (0-$6,810 in 1990); maximum credit benefit for earned incomes over the initial stage value but under the phase out value ($10,730 in 1990); and marginally decreasing benefits to earned incomes exceeding the phase out value (Scholz, 1994). Because benefits increase with earned income in the subsidy range of the credit, the program provides both the incentives to work and monetary aid to the incomes of those who need it. For these reasons, the EITC is considered a popular anti-poverty program and has thus expanded significantly over the years (Scholz, 1994).
Since its implementation thirty years ago, the system has indeed been shown to work (Holt, 2013). The EITC has stimulated spending that in many cases has paid itself off (Holt, 2013). Considering it brackets low wage-earners using a subsidy range, the approach is very well-targeted, and its empirical benefits more unequivocal than the complicated and risky minimum wage policy. It is not without its room for improvement, though. The EITC program could definitely be improved in many ways: awareness of the program could be spread more readily to areas of poverty. It also would be wise to instead invest efforts into making the earned-income tax credit policy more generous, rather than pursue a minimum wage hike with dubious consequences.
