My set of solutions to A4 – Systems of Ordinary Differential Equations is available in pdf: [20D – A4](http://nkimberly.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/week420d.pdf)

Content deals with Matrices in MATLAB, Homogenous Systems of Linear ODE's, Complex Eigenvalues, Differential Equations, Stability in Airplane Controls, and Controlling the Dutch Roll.

*(Assignments and more resources for learning MATLAB can be found here.)*
