In this experiment, an unknown organic compound was characterized through physical and reaction analytical methods. Physical analytical methods include boiling point measurements, qualitative viscosity property, color, and state. Reaction methods include IR, positive and negative chemical tests, and melting point measurements of the compounds derivatives. The scientific principles explored through this experiment are not new; however the application of oxidation-reduction chemistry as an analytical test is. All of the tests used in this experiment – Jones, Tollens, and 2,4-DNP – employed visible physical changes to indicate whether a reaction occurred or not, thus indicating some characterization of the unknown compound used.
