LifeCycled Composites is developing a device, called a hot press, that will empower waste pickers to up-cycle, or transform, their own collected waste into useful products thatcan then be sold in their local community as a means to improve the social perception of waste pickers and prevent scrap traders from taking advantage of them. Our hot press device operates by applying elevated temperature and pressure to laminate layers of paper and plastic,creating a composite material with vastly superior properties that can be crafted into useful products such as utensils, housewares, furniture, and building tiles. We plan to rent the hot presses to waste-picker cooperatives and provide training to individual waste pickers in how to up-cycle their waste into value-added products. This strategy directly enables an increase in waste-picker earnings and simultaneously brings dignity to their profession.We are seeking funding to further develop our inexpensive hot press technology in collaboration with waste pickers.
