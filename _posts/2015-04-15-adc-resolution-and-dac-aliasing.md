From this experiment it is clear that the accuracy and precision of a measurement depend upon the resolution of the instrument in relation to the voltage it is measuring, as a resolution value significantly lower than the measured values is adequate for registering and assessing those values. However, when the input voltages are on the same order of magnitude as the resolution, it is possible for substantial increases in voltage to go entirely unnoticed, resulting in inaccurate results due to systematic error.

This experiment substantiates the Nyquist­-Shannon Theorem. When sampled below the Nyquist rate, only straight lines and aliased signals are produced. At the Nyquist rate, the frequency is correctly determined, but other aspects of the frequency are not reproduced correctly.The best reproduction of the sampled frequency occurs at sampling rates five higher than the Nyquist rate.
