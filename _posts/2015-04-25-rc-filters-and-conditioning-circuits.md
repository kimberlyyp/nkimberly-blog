This experiment provides support for the use of RC circuits as high and low pass filters to selectively isolate desired frequencies by filtering out noise. Knowledge of the resistor and maximum voltage in a linear RC circuit can be used to accurately estimate the capacitance of the capacitor because the time constant, τ , is always 63% of the maximum voltage in an ideal RC circuit. Low pass filters are excellent at blocking out high frequency noises. While changes in high frequency noise did not affect the output signal, changes to the input signal were accurately depicted by the low pass filter.
