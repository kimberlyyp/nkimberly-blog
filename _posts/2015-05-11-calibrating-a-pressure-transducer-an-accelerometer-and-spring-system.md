The purpose of this lab was to calibrate a pressure transducer and accelerometer, determine the constant of a spring system, and explore the capabilities of the Wheatstone bridge, which was involved in both mentioned transducers. In the first part of this experiment, the sensitivity of the pressure transducer was determined to be 0.14103 mV/cm. Compared with the listed value of 0.14100 mV/cm, this was a 0.021277%error. In the second part of this experiment, the sensitivity of the accelerometer was determined to be 740.204 mV/g,resulting in a 48.041% error from the listed value of 500 mV/g. The third part of this experiment provided spring constants of 34.67 N/m with the static method and 54.19 N/m with the dynamic method. Finally, the last part of this experiment, 350 Ω was determined to be exactly where the bridge voltage was zero.The value resulted in a 0% error from the theoretical value of 350 Ω .
