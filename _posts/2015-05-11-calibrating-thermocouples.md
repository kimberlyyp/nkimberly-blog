The objective of this experiment was to calibrate a type K thermocouple to observe the Seebeck Effect and calculate the Biot numbers and heat transfer coefficients of aluminum and copper spheres during both free and forced convection modes of cooling. The offset of the type K thermocouple was determined to be 3.0 ± 0.5 ℃. The Biot numbers under free convection were determined to be 0.0752 for aluminum and 0.0637 for copper. Under forced convection, they were determined to be 0.6315 for aluminum and 0.3518 for copper. The heat transfer coefficients for free convection were determined to be 604.0W/(m 2K) for aluminum and 1005.7 W/(m 2K) for copper. Finally, the heat transfer coefficients for forced convection were determined to be 5071.9W/(m 2K) for aluminum and 5554.0 W/(m 2K) copper. The rate of heat loss was noticeably faster for forced convection than for free convection.The rate of heat loss was also faster for aluminum than for copper in both convection modes.
