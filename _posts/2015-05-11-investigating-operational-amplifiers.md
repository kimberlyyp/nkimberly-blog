The purpose of Laboratory Experiment 4 was to construct inverting, non-inverting, and dual stage operational amplifiers to characterize frequency responses, such as inversion, clipping, and amplification.The voltage gain of the inverting operational amplifier was 27±0.07 as calculated from theoretical values, while it was experimentally determined to be 19.2±0.5, a 29.01% error. The voltage gain of the inverting and non-inverting dual stage operational amplifier was theoretically calculated to be 54±0.07, while it was experimentally determined to be 7.34 ±0.07, an 86.40% error. In the dual-stage case, the large error is due to a broken operational amplifier, as determined by theTeachingAssistant.
