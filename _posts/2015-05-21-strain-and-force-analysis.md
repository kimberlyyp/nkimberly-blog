The purpose of this experiment was to determine the spring constant for the cantilever beam using both static and dynamic methods, analyze the signal amplification with the use of different strain gauges,calculate Young’s Modulus, compare theoretical strain measurements with experimental values, solve for Poisson’s ratio, determine the gauge factor of one strain gauge and calibrate the beam. The spring constant was determined to be 504±4 N/m using the static method and 460±30 N/m using the dynamic method. It was determined that the static method yielded a more accurate result. Young’s Modulus was found to be 63.2± 0.4 GigaN/m 2 , with an error of 8.5%.The Poisson’s ratio for aluminum was determined to be 0.312± 0.005, with a 5.45%error.The gauge factor of strain gauge 3 was found to be -2.30 ± 0.05.
