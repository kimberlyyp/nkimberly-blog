The purpose of this experiment was to explore the behavior,system gains, and feedback of a position control system. The control effort was determined to be proportional to gain, such that an increase in gain led to an increase in error. Calibration of the feedback potentiometer provided a linear fit indicating sensitivity of 0.086V/degree.Calibrating the knob gain and calculated gain from measured resistance led to a 1:0.423 ratio, which is a 57.7% error from the theoretical 1:1 ratio. Investigation of the relationship between error and gain led to a results indicating that as gain increased, error voltage decreased. Then, an experimental trial was conducted to determine how useful the calibration of the feedback potentiometer was: the percent error in discrepancy between the predicted and experimental angles were 6.41% for +5V and 4.03%for-5V. Graphs in the final part of this experiment provided results indicating that when gain increased, oscillations increased at the feedback signal, op-amp, and motor drive, while steady state errors, rise times, and overshoot stayed relatively constant. As well, it was shown that as gain increased, the settling times for the op-amp and feedback signal were likewise increased.The settling time approached zero for the motor drive.
