The objective of this report is to decide on a de-icing chemical that aligns with the priorities set by our company, Fakhimi’s Students. The scope of this report is limited to the data given as well as data made readily available to students. This report does not seek to detail the precise cost, corrosivity, environmental impact, or functional analysis of each of the chemicals and their use as deicing solution. As well, this report cannot provide precise cost data for Fakhimi’s Students. Instead, this report will focus on decision-making of a chemical solution based on projecting benefits and harms with respect to each of the chemicals by extending from assumptions.
