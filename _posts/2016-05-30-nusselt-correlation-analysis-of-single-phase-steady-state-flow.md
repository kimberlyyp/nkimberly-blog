**Abstract**

Chevron type plate heat exchangers are widely used in a variety of industries due to their large surface area and corrugations that improve flow characteristics for heat transfer. We perform Nusselt correlation analysis to parametrize the single phase hydrodynamic conditions to improve heat transfer within these heat exchangers. We determine a unique Nusselt correlation for the turbulent regime of Reynolds numbers (2000
