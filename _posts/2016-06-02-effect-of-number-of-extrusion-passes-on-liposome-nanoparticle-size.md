**Abstract**
Liposomes are lipid vesicles that may be used as nanocarriers, with applications in diagnostics and therapeutic agents. Liposomes show promise of being able to maneuver the immune system to achieve specific biomolecular targets. As nanocarriers, liposomes are favorable due to their small size, allowing intermolecular forces to dominate. In this experiment, we varied the cholesterol content of 1,2-dilauroyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DLPC) solutions as well as the number of extrusion passes through a 100 nm membrane to investigate how two experimental parameters are responsible for the particle size and polydispersity index (PDI) of liposomes. Although the size of the particles and its PDI showed no distinct trend as cholesterol content increased, particle size did decrease as number of extrusion passes was increased, with no distinct trend in PDI. The ideal particle size of 120 nm was not reached; however, we suspect slower extrusion passes and lower liposome concentration could achieve liposomes closer in size to the desired particle diameter.
