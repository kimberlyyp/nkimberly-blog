#### *Julia Pimsleur is an author, speaker and coach and the founder of Little Pim, one of the few women-run businesses backed by venture capital in the country.  During her years as CEO she discovered that only 3% of all women entrepreneurs get to $1M and wrote her best-seller, "Million Dollar Women: The Essential Guide for Female Entrepreneurs Who Want to Go Big​" to help change that.  Julia is currently on a mission to help one million women entrepreneurs break the $1M in revenues mark by 2020.*

#### Book Review #1
## Review
My best friend gifted me this book for Christmas.  It is meant for entrepreneurs looking to scale their business.  That is not who I am; however, I am interested in developing the organizational and personal skills necessary to lead large-scale initiatives in the future, so perhaps there is something interesting and useful for me, but I didn't expect there to be.  This was my perspective going in.

I allocated time to read this book for about 30 minutes every morning.  I've got to say: each of those mornings, I felt ever more driven.  I would excitedly wake up at 3:00am and reluctantly sleep at 11:00pm.  I was markedly bolder in my decision-making, more efficient at my tasks, and more kind to those around me.

The book is primarily centered around scaling up and raising venture capital funds, but Pimsleur recounts her business experience in so much detail that I felt I gained a plethora of business insight and practical tips along the way.   She covers a wide range of entrepreneurial pitfalls and provides practical and proven methods for remaining positive and pushing past naysayers.

I recommend this book to any woman looking to scale her small business or simply looking to scale her thinking.  Of course, **practice goes a lot further in business than reading**, so I highly urge those who read the book to also reflect and execute on the Pimsleur's exercises for the book and heed her call to action.

**Rating: 9/10**

## Notes
*These are my notes simply based on call for actions made by the author.*
#### CHAPTER 1: HOW I GOT OFF THE ENTREPRENEUR’S HAMSTER WHEEL
Dream big, seek mentor-ship, make time, and learn from what has worked.

List successful people, whether they be in your field, are a former professor, coach, etc. and schedule a coffee or call with them when you've formulated a plan for review.

Name a successful company in your industry and read their case studies. Figure out their model and share with people helping to grow your business.

Figure out your *twenty-foot chasm* and brainstorm ways to cross it.
#### CHAPTER 2: POWERFUL AND PREPARED, NOT PRETTY AND PERFECT
List your top 3 limiting beliefs about yourself as a business person.

Write each belief again, but affirming that you are the opposite of those.

Write down your top priorities for change.

List some people who can help you achieve your priorities.

What is something you have failed at, and what strength did it give you?
#### CHAPTER 3: IDENTIFY YOUR ALLIES, YOUR FOES, AND YOUR FRENEMIES
Who are the friends you can count on to cheerlead as you seek to grow your company and learn new skills?

Who are your frenemies that you need to find a new way of spending time with that doesn't involve discussing your business because it's too demoralizing?

Who needs to get moved down your social list if you are going to go big?
#### CHAPTER 4: BE LIKE NOTRE DAME, NOT THE EIFFEL TOWER
Find your flying buttresses. Make a chart that shows areas of your business where you need help and whether you think an adviser or paid coach will help.

List three people who are already helping you, even if it’s just informally, and can potentially serve as one of your advisers or connect you to someone in their network/

Craft an email to existing advisers to ask them to be an official adviser. Once they have accepted, ask them to connect you to others so you can build your advisory council.
#### CHAPTER 5: TURN MOXIE INTO MONEY
Before raising money, meet with advisers, seasons entrepreneurs, and coaches who understand the various types of fundraising (angel, venture, loans, crowdfunding, or other) to determine which kind of capital makes the most sense.

Some questions to consider for advisers,

	What kind of money should I raise?
	When is the right time?
	Where do I learn the fundraising dance?
	How much equity and control will I have to give up?

Some preparation before speaking to advisers:

	Explain what you expect to achieve by raising capital.
	What is the *money-making machine* at the heart of your business?
	What challenges will your business face in becoming scalable?
	Which part of your business is scalable?

Then, to actually raise capital, learn the fundraising dance.

	Know the problem you are solving.
	Explain why your company needs to happen now, and why you are the right person for the job.
	Credential yourself well.
	Practice for a confident and authentic presentation style.
	Paint the big picture.
	Know your numbers.
	Talk about the business of business- and why your revenues will be reliable and repeatable.
	Explain why your business is scalable.
	Know the competitors in your space, and what differentiates your business from others.
	Have a great team.
	Show that you are coachable.
	Have a good lawyer.
	Practice your pitch with an audience.

#### CHAPTER 6: SLIP INTO SOMETHING MORE COMFORTABLE
Be efficient with your networking- decide whether the event will be worth attending and track the outcome to help speculate future events. Events worth attending should help you solve short- or long- term problems, meet strategic partners, or double as a social event to provide motivational energy.

Choose events where you *won't* be the smartest person in the room.
#### CHAPTER 7: DELEGATE YOUR WAY TO THE TOP
Find your Best and Brightest Times: track everything you do for 3 days and how long each task takes. At the end of each day, write down everything you did, from the time you spend getting dressed to answering emails and going to the supermarket.

Create a spreadsheet and group activities into Brain Work, Workout, Play Time, Chores, etc. On a different tab, write down when you think you do each type of work best. Compare that with your actual schedule and adjust your schedule to honor these times. Make sure to tell people in your life why you are making these changes.

What are three things you can delegate? Outsource three things that you are doing at home to a babysitter, cleaning service, etc.. Do the same for work. Make sure you do the job yourself first at least once so you can hand it off properly. Trust but verify: hand it off and make sure it was done correctly. Give feedback to grow and promote your staff.
#### CHAPTER 8: PUTTING THE PERSON BACK IN YOUR PERSONAL LIFE
Plan to take care of yourself.
