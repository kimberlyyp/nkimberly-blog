#### Book Review #2
## Review
This 382-page book is packed with valuable teachings and provides readers a deep dive into code, computation, and computers. * Code * begins with an exploration of why we developed Morse Code and Braille, and progresses to discuss how we came about relays and telegraph networks. Petzold goes even further by teaching readers the fundamentals of computing logic and how oscillators enable memory in computers.

I don't think any prior knowledge of computers and programming is required for the first 3/4 of *Code*, but the latter 1/4 feels a little rushed and is riddled with highly specific and technical concepts pertaining to microprocessors, ASCII, and graphical rendering on computers. It felt like the author was trying to fit far too much into far too little space during the ending chapters.

While I wish the ending chapters would be rewritten to match the pace of the rest of the book, I would recommend that, overall, *Code* is a great read for any programmer who doesn't already know the fundamentals of computer hardware and software.

**Rating: 9/10**
