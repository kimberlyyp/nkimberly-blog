#### Book Review #4
## Review
Sean Carroll begins his book with an overview of the standard model and four fundamental forces of the universe. I appreciate that he paces his book so that new topics are introduced alongside plenty of examples and fun trivia.
With the overview out of the way, Carroll accelerates into details surrounding the construction, test plan, detection design, and statistical rigor involved in working the Large Hadron Collider. The depictions of the LHC, the Feynman diagrams, and the standard model he includes make the complex concepts readily digestible.
With grace and respect, Carroll proceeds to highlight the tortuous events leading up to the discovery of the Higgs Mechanism. Warning: there is a lot of drama! I was pleasantly surprised to learn that it was the BCS Theory developed in research of superconductors that led to one of the “a-ha!” moments of symmetry breaking.
Carroll then closes with a discussion of how the Higgs discovery opens a portal for humankind toward insight on dark matter, vacuum energy, and m-theory.
**Rating: 10/10**

## Notes
#### The Point
Physics rests on the exercise of trying to disprove theories, in hopes of landing at better and better ones. And yet, 30+ years of accelerator work have overwhelmingly *supported* the standard model developed in the 1970s.  We're at a point where physics has pushed the boundaries of understanding so far that we need to build a $9 billion dollar accelerator just to gather new data in attempt to find flaws in, and improve, the standard model.

#### Next to Godliness
Fermions are particles that make up matter; they take up space. Bosons are particles that carry force; they can pile on top of one another. Bosons *should* be massless according to symmetry. And yet they aren't -- which insists that there must be symmetry breaking.
Indeed, that is the explanation put forth by the team behind the now famous Higgs mechanism, where a nonzero Higgs field provides a medium by which particles gain mass as a property, slowing down fermions and lending mass to weak gauge bosons.
Without the Higgs, or something even more bizarre to take its place, the Standard Model wouldn't get off the ground. All fermions (yes even the electron!) would have zero mass and move at the speed of light.
There are four fundamental forces in the standard model: gravity (graviton, gauge boson), electromagnetism (photon, gauge boson), strong nuclear force (gluon, gauge boson), and weak nuclear force (Z, W+, and W-, gauge bosons). It is the electroweak symmetry that is broken by the Higgs mechanism.

#### Atoms and Particles
Interactions with the Higgs field lead to mass. The more strongly a particle couples to the Higgs, the more massive it is. Indeed, the quarks, charged leptons, W and Z bosons are all massive.

#### The Accelerator Story
1950's saw the Bevatron in Berkeley, CA, which contributed to the discovery of the antiproton and platinum-irridium layer that revealed the asteroid extinction of dinosaurs.
1954 saw the establishment of CERN council with 12 countries
1957 Synchrocyclotron at 00.6 GeV
1959 Proton synchotron at 28 GeV
1971 Intersecting storage rings at 62 GeV
1976 Super proton synchotron at 300 GeV, then upgraded to proton-antiproton collider that led to the discovery of W and Z bosons, now sitting at 450 GeV
1989 Large electron positron, shut down in 2000 to make room for Large Hadron Collider.

#### Largest Machine Ever Built
LHC features include superconducting magnets that drive particles around a torus-shaped tunnel comprised of 8 segments with a 17 mile circumference and 330 ft underground. Came to life in 2008 only to explode nine days later. LHC was shut down and wasn't brought back up for another year.
During construction, workers randomly bumped into a Roman era villa! Had to stop construction for a bit to allow archaeologists and historians in. 500 trillion protons circulate in 2 beems, one clockwise and one counter clockwise. Tunnels were tested for obstruction by rolling a ping pong ball with sensors along length!

#### Wisdom Through Smashing
My favorite part of this book -- how the LHC detects!
General concept: smash particles and analyze traces through statistics, separation techniques, and various sensors.

Inner layers of the detector are least dense, while the outer layers are most dense. Every part of every layer of detector is populated with thousands of cables connected to an electronic readout system. The system records the exact place and time of each interaction.
Regarding the detectors, it boils down to two kinds: (1) semiconductor detectors to evaluate charged particles and (2) calorimeters to measure particle energy.
The electromagnetic calorimeter effectively stops particles that lose energy over short distances, such as photons and electrons. The hadronic calorimeter at the next layer then captures the particles that have a bit more energy than photons and electrons, i.e. hadrons such as protons and neutrons. Calorimeters themselves may have no difference in materials; they are simply named as such based on succession and calibration. Finally, the muon detector is basically the furthest detector, reached by the muons.
Differentiation of particles within each layer is conducted based on the trajectory, since charged particles will exhibit varying curvature in response to directional current. Neutrinos are the only particles not captured by the detection scheme, but can be deduced based on energy input.

#### Particle in the Waves
High mass implies short wavelength, and therefore that particle would actually take up *less* space.

#### Through a Broken Mirror
With this in mind, electrons take up the most space of an atom due to its low mass. Conversely, massive protons and neutrons take up *less* space.
The electroweak phase transition is calculated to have happened after about 1 trillionth of a second after the Big Bang, giving rise to an average Higgs field of some nonzero value.

#### Bringing Down the House
Gluon fusion turned out to be the most important way that the Higgs is produced at LHC. Here is a Feynman diagram depicting gluon fusion, among other fusion modes.

#### **Nobel Dreams**
Discovery of Higgs mechanism:
In 1949, Julian found that forces based on symmetry will be carried by massless particles, i.e. force carriers called gauge bosons. Ginzburg Lev Landau found that fields give mass to an ordinarily massless photon in his research on superconductivity. Bardeen, Cooper, and Schrieffer developed on this by coining 'Cooper pairs', a phenomena where electrons can couple together via photos and behave like bosons.
In 1961, Julian Schwinger added that there may be ways for a gauge boson to acquire mass. BCS theory was developed further by the idea that photons associated with cooper pairs have effective mass and therefore a minimum energy. Therefore, below a critical temperature, cooper pairs do not have enough energy to make any photons, and therefore can't lose energy. Voila! That's why cooper pairs can flow through material with zero resistance.
In 2008, Nambu was one of the first to understand spontaneous symmetry breaking, to suggest the existence of gluons, to propose quark colors, and to point at the possibility of strings.
Indeed, Nambu and Lasinio developed in many ways the precursor to the Higgs mechanism, pointing out that breaking could occur even in empty space if there is a nonzero field. Goldstone added to this the idea that a breakdown of global symmetry would produce a massless boson. Spin zero introduced.
Anderson suggested, contrary to Nambu and Goldstone as well as Yang and Mills, that the boson would be massive. Higgs mechanism however was attributed to the following inventors: Englert, Higgs, Hagen, Guralnik, and Kibble.

#### Making It Worth Defending
Pastore: Is there anything connected in the hopes of this accelerator that in any way involves the security of this country?
Wilson: No sir; I do not believe so.
Pastore: Nothing at all?
Wilson: Nothing at all.
Pastore: It has no value in that respect?
Wilson: It only has to do with the respect with which we regard one another, the dignity of men, our love of culture. It has to do with those things. It has nothing to do with the military, I am sorry.
Pastore: Don’t be sorry for it.
Wilson: I am not, but I cannot in honesty say it has any such application.
Pastore: Is there anything here that projects us in a position of being competitive with the Russians, with regard to this race?
Wilson: Only from a long-range point of view, of a developing technology. Otherwise, it has to do with: Are we good painters, good sculptors, great poets? I mean all the things that we really venerate and honor in our country and are patriotic about. In that sense, this new knowledge has all to do with honor and country but it has nothing to do directly with defending our country, except to make it worth defending.
