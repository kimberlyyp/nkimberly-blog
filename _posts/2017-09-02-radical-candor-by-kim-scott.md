#### **Book Review #8**
## Review
A friend of mine gifted me **Radical Candor** by Kim Scott for my birthday (perhaps because I loved my other friend so much for gifting me **Million Dollar Women** by Julia Pimsleur for Christmas). Although I was actually in the middle of another book I knew I had to drop everything and invest time in Radical Candor. I have a filter problem, so it is no surprise that the title alone persuaded me.

Kim Scott delivered. Big time.

I've found that there are two requirements to getting to the truth of things: being honest and requesting feedback. Being honest comes second nature to me, but requesting feedback does not.

Through Kim's work, I've come to understand the value of requesting feedback. And in turn, I see how important it is to prepare and provide feedback to others- not only the good, but also the bad and in between. We owe it to one another to care personally and challenge directly. Be honest about what we and others are good at and could improve on.

Caring personally and challenging directly are at the heart of what Kim defines as Radical Candor. And we owe it to ourselves to cultivate Radical Candor in our teams.

This book alone has inspired over numerous action items to help me regularly obtain feedback from my peers and grow from the feedback in ways that can accelerate my career. Even more significant, Kim has given me a solid framework that  I can leverage to improve the work I do and develop into the person I want to be to others.
