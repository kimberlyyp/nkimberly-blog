My first exposure to Design Thinking was in my Global Teams in Engineering Service course. Lecturer Brandon Reynante walked through each of the steps- emphasize, define, ideate, prototype, and test- and had us partner up with a classmate. After a series of empathy interviews and feedback sessions with our respective customers, we prototyped backpacks for each other out of construction paper and pipe cleaners.

My takeaway at the time was that we could design more **context-appropriate **solutions that would answer to customer's needs, both implicit and explicit. In our case, we designed backpacks that were tailored to each student's needs.

Since then, I've encountered the methodology here and there, without it really making much of a huge impact.  It wasn't until this past week, when I attended a Design Thinking Workshop hosted by HP that something clicked.

Perhaps it was because I now have over a year of experience in the workforce, or because of the way in which the workshop was facilitated, or some combination of both, but I suddenly realized I had been needlessly scoping this methodology to only creator-customer engagements. ***But Design Thinking can be so much more than that!***

We can think of **any** engagement we have with other people as creator-customer engagements. They don't have to be 'official' business customers.

This dawned on me when I went to an outside mentor for help regarding a confrontation at work. During a pause in the confrontation, I took a break to regroup and explain the situation to a personal mentor.

(For the sake of confidentiality, I have replaced names with 'person' and needs with 'quality A/B/C' and options with 'option I/II/III'. I do wish I could describe the story in all its details, as I do think the story is compelling because of the details. Alas, another day I can find a story that is compelling but whose details don't need to be redacted.)
So there's this person who says they want quality A.
I say, Option I gives you quality A.
But this person refuses Option I and instead asks for Option II.
I ask why they would need Option II? Option II would forego quality B, which is something another person needs.
They respond, because of quality A.
I explain again that Option I already gives quality A-- without foregoing the needs of another person.
They respond option I doesn't give them quality A in the *right way**.***
*Whatever that means, *I thought. I was frustrated, I could tell. I've learned that when adrenaline comes into a conversation, ***everyone* **makes poor decisions. This is a well-understood and documented physiological phenomenon. So I asked for us to resume the conversation later.

During this break, my mentor and I spoke at length, and the result of our conversation was enlightening. He admits,
Sometimes, I know what **a correct solution **looks like for my needs, but** I don't precisely know what my needs are**. And instead of figuring that out, I hone in on the solution that I know would support my needs, and I plant myself firmly there... Until a couple of days later, I realize what my needs were, and another solution could have worked had I been able to better understand my own needs. **In your case, it may be that you need to discuss with this person what it is they *actually* want.**
There it is- the empathy interview.

So I took all the strategies I learned during the interview lecture, and facilitated a conversation with this person the next day.

Indeed, it turned out that they also wanted another quality-- Quality C. And from that finding, it became laughingly easy to suggestion an Option III, which allows for all qualities A and C without foregoing quality B.

We can all treat our daily interactions- particularly with our managers and peers as client-user engagements. Understanding others' needs, especially getting to the bottom of those implicit needs, is a game-changer.

That's just the **Empathy -> Define -> Ideate** step. There are still yet the **prototype -> test steps!** And all of the cycling back that happens in order to develop a good solution.

Design Thinking gives us the tools to navigate these steps more successfully- and more importantly- remember to do them.

For example, in the workshop, it was duly emphasized how important it is to test, test, test! We must be eager for feedback and we must listen. To help with eliciting *honest *feedback, a good strategy is to** show unfinished work**. It goes against the grain of perfectionists, but studies have shown that people are ***less* likely to give thorough and/or critical feedback **when a product or solution looks like it is nearly wrapped up or finished.

So let's not limit ourselves nor limit the scope of Design Thinking. Let's emphathize, define, ideate, prototype, and test every day.
