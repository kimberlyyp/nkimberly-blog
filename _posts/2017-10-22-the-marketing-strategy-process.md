The marketing process is a circular function. Marketing plans undergo many revisions until all parts are *internally consistent and mutually supportive.* There are many variations of this process, but perhaps the most comprehensive one is the 7 step process:

	Consumer Analysis
	Market Analysis
	Review of the Competition and Self
	Review of Distribution Channels
	Development of a "Preliminary" Marketing Mix
	Evaluation of the Economics
	Revision and Extension of Steps 1-6 until a consistent plan emerges

# Step I.     Consumer Analysis
All plans should begin with an assessment of needs.

**What is the need category? **

Brainstorm all possible uses of a product or service.
```
*Baking soda may also be used as air freshener, toothpaste, etc.*
```
**Who's buying and who's using? **

Buyers may be different from users.
```
*Women make the majority of men's underwear and sock purchases.*
```
**What is the buying process?**

Hypothesize how the product is purchased. Run through the following steps,

	Awareness
	Info Search
	Evaluate
	Purchase
	Evaluate Purchase

```
*Advertisement reminds a person to check their scent. *
*Person realizes they smell bad. *
*Person asks partner about what soap to use. *
*Person buy's partner's recommendation. *
*Parter likes it and so does person.... Good purchase!*
```
**Is what I am selling high involvement or low involvement?**

A product is a high involvement product if consumers feel a high level of risk involved in the purchase decision.

![anku-buybehvr](https://nkimberly.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/anku-buybehvr.jpg)
```
Quadrant I- Variety Seeking Buying Behavior: toothpaste, candy
Quadrant II- Complex Buying Behavior: cars, home appliances
Quadrant III- Dissonance Reducing Behavior: diamonds
Quadrant IV- Habitual Buying Behavior: sugar, rice, salt
```
We can convert items in quadrant IV to quadrant I by linking it to a high involvement issue.
```
no-cholesterol cooking oil -> reduces risk of heart attack.
```
**Do I intend to segment the market?**

If the product is for everyone, then a mass market strategy is required. If not, we must choose a segment or segments of the market to target.
```
*Coca-cola: mass market*
*Snapple: specialty tea in more narrowly defined market segment*
```
**How do we segment?**

Identify segment large enough to serve profitably and accessible enough to be reached by marketing efforts. Four major variables of segmentation are,
```
*- Geographic*
*- Demographic*
*- Psychographic*
*- Behavioral*
```
Small segments are important too.
```
*Xerox controlled 88% of copier market in 1980 but ignored small copier market... 
This resulted in Xerox losing over half of its market share to Canon, Ricoh, and Sharp.
Smaller companies were tired of walking across the street just to make copies. 
The Japanese companies were able to dominate this small segment, providing a foothold to topple Xerox.*
```
# Step II.     Market Analysis
Segmentation analysis focuses on consumers as individuals. The market analysis takes on a broader view of potential customers to include market size and trends analysis.

**What is the relevant market?**

The relevant market is the market after the total market has been sliced. Marketing research will need to be conducted. Armed with market research, we now need to evaluate whether it is large or accessible enough to justify marketing efforts. Not all makable products are marketable. Only marketable products make money.

Answers will not be readily available for new products, although test markets may be used to obtain that information.

**Where is the product in its life cycle?**

Understanding PLC can give us the MBA insight that competitors lack.

![Characteristics-of-the-Product-Life-Cycle-Stages-and-their-Marketing-Implications-1024x613](https://nkimberly.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/characteristics-of-the-product-life-cycle-stages-and-their-marketing-implications-1024x613.png?w=1024)
**Intro Phase, "What is it?" **This phase is characterized by,

```
*High advertising costs to raise awareness. *
*Exclusive distribution.*
*Early adopters and innovators who freely take purchase risks.*
*Frequent product changes based on early adopter needs.*
*Careful price point, which sets precedent for product category.*
```
**Growth Phase, "Where can I buy?"**

```
*Selective Distribution can help to open distribution more.*
*Very important to beat the competition at this point.*
*Higher revenue will reduce the cost of the product*
*       + provide an advantage in next stage of PLC.*
*So... Sell! Sell! Sell!*
```
**Maturity Phase, "Why this one?"**

```
*Late majority often purchases based on brand loyalty.*
*Advertising is now the vehicle to differentiate products *
*       since most features have now become standard *
*       and there are less actual differences between products. *
*Marketing managers can now try to segment target market as much as possible*
*       in order to meet specific unmet customer needs.*
```
**Decline, "How much?"**

```
*Laggards turn a deaf ear to advertising. *
*Everyone knows it is safe to buy now.*
*Companies must turn to reducing cost *
*       OR if the competitive field has thinned, *
*       slowly increase the cost to make up for sales decrease.*
*Trade relations are important to keep items on the shelf at this point. *
*       This is called 'relationship marketing'.*
*Occasionally, companies can pull off the 'endgame strategy'. *
*       When all competition is gone, pricing can be set very high... *
```
**What are the key competitive factors in this industry?**
```
*Quality, price, advertising, R&D, and service are the battlegrounds.*
```
# Step III.     Competitive Analysis
Develop a plan to beat the competition by leveraging company core competencies.

**What is your company good at vs. competitors?**
```
*Frito Lay: Distribution*
*Apple: New Product Development & Introduction*
*Geico: Advertising*
```
**What is your position in the market?**
```
*- Market Size and Relative Market Share*
*- Financial Position*
*- Historical Performance + Reputation*
```
**What are your resources?**

If certain resources are barriers to entry, consider piggybacking...
```
*- People*
*- Manufacturing*
*- Trade relations*
*- Sales force*
*- Cash *
*- Technology, patents, R&D *
```
**What are the market shares of industry players?**

Smaller entrants shouldn't assume that they can topple giants. Large companies can produce much cheaper goods due to the supply chain, so start with an analysis of the competition most similar to the entrant.

**How does product perceptually map against the competitor?**

Perceptual mapping is a graphic way to compare against competitors. Price vs. Quality is one, but others are acceptable too.

![screen-shot-2014-11-23-at-17-22-57](https://nkimberly.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/screen-shot-2014-11-23-at-17-22-57.png)

**How is my product positioned against the competitor?**
```
10 Rules of positioning
**1. Own a word in a customer's mind.**
       *e.g. Fedex "overnight delivery"*
**2. Positioning begins with the product's name.**
       Should be descriptive and establish the main benefit.
*       e.g. Draino opens clogged drains.*
**3. If you have a unique new product, use a new name.**
*       e.g. Called it iPod, not Apple Mini Mac.*
**4. Easiest way to own a word is to be first.**
*       e.g. Kleenex cleans running noses.*
**5. Don't stray from your message.**
*       e.g. Nike's Just Do It***
6. Reinforce the original concept in all activities.**
*       e.g. "Coke classic is the real thing!"*
**7. Best way to respond to a new competitor is to introduce a new brand.**
*       e.g. In response to bottled water taking market share, Coke released Dasani-- not Coke Water.*
**8. The first option for a follower is to establish on new category.**
       Established brands are tough to beat, 
       but consumers will adopt a new category more easily.
*       e.g. Charles Schwab established discount brokerage.*
**9. The second option is to find an open position.**
*       e.g. Starbucks became the premier quick-service coffeeshop.*
**10. The third option is to reposition the competitor.**
*       e.g. Tylenol burst the aspirin bubble. "If your stomach is easily upset... or you have an ulcer... or you suffer from asthma, allergies, or iron-deficiency anemia, it would make good sense to check with your doctor before you take aspirin.' *
```
# Step IV.    Distribution Channel Analysis
Channels influence price, and therefore profit margins.

**How can my product reach the customer?**
```
- Wholesalers
- Distributors
- Sales Representatives
- Sales forces
- Retailers
```
**How much do the players in each distribution channel profit?**

Everyone who touched the merchandise gets a cut. A channel sketch will provide insight into the retail price that must be charged to make a profit.  Participants in the distribution channel 'take margin' from the manufacturer.
```
% Markup on selling price = ($ mark up / $ selling price) * 100
```
Every channel participant adds to the cost. This is how $1 of coffee beans turns into $6 for a consumer. We can bypass grocers and middlemen by option for direct mail order.

**Who holds the power in each distribution channel?**

If a product is unique and in demand, then the manufacturer has the power to outline terms. If not, intermediaries will be able to dictate terms and take as much margin as possible. In grocery trade, power has shifted from manufacturers to supermarkets. Marketers even diagram their shelves to advertise their space. Slotting fees can be paid to reserve slots on shelves for both new and existing products.

**What is the internet's role as a channel of distribution?**

Four C's of internet marketing.
```
Commerce- 24hr storefront capability
Content- extension of product such as service, support, etc.
Customer Care- access to account details, delivery tracking, FAW
Convert Leads-
```
# Step V.     Marketing Mix
**Product | Place | Promotion | Price**
The goal of developing the marketing mix is an internally consistent and mutually supportive action plan. Tinkering with any one of the 'P's will likely alter the others.

**1. Product Decisions**
**How does product fit with existing product line?**

```
*e.g. should a computer company make hairdryers?*
```
**How will I differentiate my products?**

```
*e.g. features, styling, reliability, packaging, sizes, services, & brand.*
```
**How does the product life cycle affect my plans?**

```
*Growth: differentiation is important.*
*Maturity: branding is increasingly important.*
```
**2. Placement Decisions**
**What distribution strategy should I use?**

```
**Exclusive**: sell only in one outlet of each market.
**Selective**: sell only in a few outlets in each market. 
       e.g. designer only sells at Neiman Marcus
**Mass**: Sell in as many outlets as possible. 
       e.g. Car window sun shield tries to sell as many as possible.
```
Place of sale affects the perception of a product. Equally important is evolving the process to match the diffusion strategy. The longer the distribution chain, the less control the manufacturer has over the image.

**3. Promotional Decisions**
**Evaluate both push and pull strategies.**

```
- Push distributors to stock product
- Pull buyers to seek out product
```
**Advertising**

```
- Define intended mission
- Understand quantitative measurements
```

	**Reach**: % of target market who see or hear the ad.
	**Frequency**: # of times audience sees or hears the ad.
	**Gross rating points** = Reach * Frequency
	**Impressions**: Total # of times a particular person has seen the ad.
	Programs with specific audiences are stronger for the compatible demographic than programs with muddled demographics.
	Ad content is known as **copy**, or a **creative**, while developers of these ideas are known as **creatives**.
	**Share of voice** is the relative exposure of one advertiser to another on a given publishing platform.

**Personal Selling**
For direct and customized contact. Good for expensive, complex, or new products.  Personal selling is a problem-solving consultation process. Salespeople should sell benefits that solve buyer's problems. World of sales is de-emphasizing the music man, the animated catalog, or magic formula models of selling.
**Sales Promotions**
**Consumer sales promotions**

```
**coupons:** encourage trial, brand switching
**rebates:** lower perceived cost
**samples:** expensive but provides a way to trial sensory products
**self-liquidating promotion:** generates enough revenue to 
       cover the cost of the entire promotion campaign
**contests/sweepstakes:** borderline gambling, so highly regulated
```
**Trade-directed sales promotions**

```
**Point of purchase displays (POP):** in retail, POP can be 
       - a shelf-talker
       - a free-standing aisle display
       - an endcap, etc... 
       to get these prime spots, manufacturer must entice the retailer.
**Spiffs:** Payments made to dealers for marketing support. 
       Spiffs enable dealer to justify carrying a product. 
       May also award prizes for meeting sales targets.
**Trade shows:** promote new or existing product to distributors,
```
**Public Relations & Publicity**

```
Create favorable climate for product
Difficult to measure. Typically polls are conducted.
Sponsorship for charity- halo effect
Influencers to help with viral marketing.
Publicity is defined as unpaid advertising. 
     Perceived as more authentic but is less controlled.
```
**Direct Selling**

```
Direct sales are a huge business.
They live by the mantra, 'segment, segment, segment!'
Lists can be developed internally or purchased from vendors.
The more defined, affluent, and focused the list, the higher the CPM.
Rates are tracked by the RoR and dollar amount per order.
Search engine marketing is sold as cost per click basis. 
The issue with direct selling is the 'big brother' threat... 
People don't like that companies have lists with so much detail on them.
```
**Price**
**Cost Plus: **A simple method of taking cost and adding the desired margin. Highway contractors do this but it's not a proper way to price.
**Perceived value to customer: **Sometimes biggest margin isn't the application itself but the margin made through replacement components of the application.
**Skimming: **For new products, high costs for novelty, for R&D or just because.
**Penetration: **Low price for companies trying to penetrate a market and gain market share.
**Price/Quality relationship: **Sometimes price affects perceived quality.
**Meet profit goals: **If the market is limited in size, then pricing must be changed to allow enough profitability to justify the marketing and manufacturing effort.
**Price elasticity: **Elastic demand is when consumers purchase less as the price is increased. Inelastic demand is when consumers purchase the same, regardless of price.

# Step VI.     Evaluate the Economics
**What are my costs? Fixed or variable?**

Fixed costs are associated with investments that don't vary with sales volume. Variable costs are those that do. Total costs are the sum of these.

**What is my break even and is it reasonable?**

The break-even point can be calculated as a volume or a retail sales value. The break-even volume is the fixed costs divided by the unit contribution. The break-even retail value is the volume multiplied by the retail price.

**What is the payback period?**

The payback period is the initial investment divided by the annual profit.
# Here's a Case Study on Gourmet Coffee
A sample demographics of gourmet coffee buyers:
```
**- 25 yrs old**
**- college-educated**
**- professional/executive employee**
**- childless household**
**- household with income > $100k**
```
A sample size obtainable market for gourmet coffee:
```
- 11B coffee sold in U.S.
- 6.6B of that is retail coffee
- 750M of that is gourmet coffee
- 450M of that has no artificial flavorings
**- 248M of that is sold in supermarkets**
```
Key competitive factors of gourmet coffee:
```
**- price**
**- quality**
```
The gourmet coffee company will start small, so should not expect to topple well-established giants. Consider the market share controlled by smaller competitors.
```
In 1989, 18% of the ground coffee market was controlled by smaller competitors.
This is up 2% from 1986. 
**Conclusion: relatively favorable environment for a new entrant.**
```
Our gourmet coffee will be priced,
```
**high**
- to assure customers the grounds are of quality
- to account for unique packaging
- and to justify targetted promotion
```
Our gourmet coffee will be distributed
```
**selectively**
- so that the image is controlled,
- and margins remain high for the manufacturer 
while maintaining a reasonable price for consumers
```
Our gourmet coffee business costs are as follows,
```
**Coffee beans cost: $1.00 lb, Variable**
**Roasting & Processing: $0.44 lb, Variable**
**Packaging Cost: $0.55 lb, Variable**
**Shipping Cost: $0.25 lb, Variable**
**Spiffs and Slotting Fees: $50,000, Fixed**
**Production Equipment: $12,000, Fixed**
**Promotional Efforts: $150,000 Fixed**
```
If we sell at,

	Selling Price to Distributors: $4.20 lb.
	Retail Sales Price: $6.00 lb.

Then our break-even point is,
```
Break-even Vol. = Fixed Costs / Unit Contribution
Break-even Vol. = ($50k + $12k + $150k) / ($4.20 - (1.00 + 0.44 + 0.55 + 0.25))
**Break-even Vol. = 108,163 lbs**
```
The retail sales would be,
```
Break-even Retail Sales = 108,163 lbs * $6.00 lbs**
Break-even Retail Sales = $649k**
```
This is approximately 0.3% of the 248M target gourmet market. Let's assume we profit about 30k every year. The payback period on investment would be,
```
Payback Period = Fixed Costs / Profits = $212k / $30k 
**Payback Period = 7 years**
```
## **Conclusion: This is a long time for such a risky venture. **Go back through steps 1-6.
