Important ethics topics taught at MBA schools include corporate social responsibility, relativism, stakeholder analysis, and The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.
### I. Corporate Social Responsibility
Silbiger begins the section with the following remark,
*"Talk about ethics rests on the assumption that businesses ought to adhere to a socially responsible approach to decision making called the 'social responsibility' approach... It is argued that because corporations are so powerful, they have an obligation to assume social responsibilities."*
What is the 'social responsibility' approach?
*[The] proponents [of the corporate social responsibility approach] argue that corporations need to be managed for the benefit of all stakeholders, including customers, employees, local communities and their owners. *
This is in contrast to the profit-maximizing approach, which posits that,
*Businesses are in the business of maximizing shareholders' value, as long as activities of the business are within the letter of the law.*
To clarify, profit maximization and social responsibility aren't necessarily mutually exclusive. Indeed, extensive research shows that corporate social responsibility leads to profit maximization in the long run. In other words, **serve a purpose-- and the profits will naturally follow. **[Check out the research here.](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2461003)

### II. Relativism
To understand relativism, we should recognize its four forms,

	Naive Relativism
	Role Relativism
	Social Group Relativism
	Cultural Relativism

Naive Relativists believe that, because so many variables affect behavior, no one who doesn't know the whole story can make a moral judgment about another's behavior.

Role Relativists believe that one must set aside personal beliefs and do what their role in requires them to do. "I don't like killing dolphins but as CEO, I must maximize profits..."

Social Group Relativists believe that morality is determined by the norms of one's peer group... In other words, what's accepted by the group is moral. "Everybody cheats..."

Cultural Relativists believe that morality is relative to a particular culture, so we have no right to criticize what another culture believes is permissible. "When in Rome..."
### III. Stakeholder Analysis
I loved this section!

First, we start with a list of stakeholders. These can range from executives to customers, employees, the community, and the environment.

Then, we set up a table. Below is an example of the stakeholder analysis of the decision to preserve the habitat of the spotted owl by reducing logging on federal lands.

Through this grid, we can juxtapose the cost of lower profits for lumber companies to the benefit of survival for owls and trees. The most compelling aspect of this grid is the rights & responsibilities row. While loggers have the rights to reasonably exploit natural resources-- owls and trees have the right to life.
### IV. Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
Let's start with some background. Prior to 2001, Enron - a large and publicly traded company - had a national reputation for consistency. But in late 2001, the world discovered accounting irregularities in Enron's financial statements. Within weeks of this discovery, Enron stocks went from over $90/share to nearly worthless!

Enron had altered its statements to hide losses from previous years.

As a result of this deception, investors started looking into the records of other large corporations. Unethical practices were also found at Adelphia, AOL, Merck & Co., Merrill Lynch, Peregrine Systems, WorldCom, and Kmart. [See the full list here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accounting_scandals).

In response, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act was introduced into Congress by U.S. Senator Paul Sarbanes (D-MD) and U.S. Representative Michael G. Oxley (R-OH).

In brief, elements of the act are as follows,

	*Officers of the company are required to sign financial statements for accuracy, holding them personally accountable.*
	*Increased fines and sentences for individuals who attempt to defraud investors or misrepresent actual figures.*
	*Companies must provide a description of internal controls.*
	*Companies are responsible for hiring an independent accounting firm to audit the accuracy of their financial reports.*
	*Companies are now mandated to report all off-balance transactions on reports.*
	*The SEC is empowered to investigate companies suspected of fraud. The SEC will conduct random reviews of companies to ensure compliance.*

**ALL U.S. publicly traded companies, subsidiaries of foreign companies in the U.S., and private companies that are preparing an IPO are required to comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.**

## From the author,
*After I earned my MBA, I had a chance to reflect on the two most exhausting and fulfilling years of my life. As I reviewed my course notes, I realized that the basics of an MBA education were quite simple and could easily be understood by a wider audience...*

*The basics of MBA knowledge fall into nine disciplines. Some schools have carefully crafted their own exalted names for each subject, but their unglorified names are:*

	*Marketing*
	*Ethics*
	*Accounting*
	*Organizational Behavior*
	*Quantitative Analysis*
	*Finance*
	*Operations*
	*Economics*
	*Strategy*

This particular post covers Day 2: Ethics.
