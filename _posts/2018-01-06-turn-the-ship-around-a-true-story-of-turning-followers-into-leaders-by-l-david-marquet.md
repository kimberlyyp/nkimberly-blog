#### A 1981 U.S. Naval Academy graduate, Captain Marquet served in the U.S. submarine force for 28 years. After being assigned to command the nuclear powered submarine USS Santa Fe, then ranked last in retention and operational standing, he realized the traditional leadership approach of “take control, give orders,” wouldn’t work. He turned his ship around by treating the crew as leaders, not followers, and giving control, not taking control. This approach took the Santa Fe from worst to first, achieving the highest retention and operational standings in the navy [[source](https://www.amazon.com/L.-David-Marquet/e/B008GHTFN2/ref=dp_byline_cont_book_1)].

## Review
At first, I found the author's tone to be pretentious. As the book progressed, however, the narration eased from pretentious to enlightening.

"Turn the Ship Around!" by Captain Marquet details the story of how the leader-leader model transformed the worst performing nuclear submarines to one of the absolute best. Before Marquet, the USS Santa Fe ranked last in retention and operation standing. During Marquet and years after his departure even, the Santa Fe has won numerous awards, promoted a disproportionate number of officers, and ranked highest in retention and operational standing.

While lessons on the USS Santa Fe don't initially seem to be relevant to our everyday civilian lives, Marquet decouples the overarching strategy from the context of the ship so well that the advice he presents has become very much relevant across industries. Check out this letter: [From nuclear submarines to graduate medical education: applying David Marquet’s intent-based leadership model.](https://mmrjournal.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s40779-017-0140-7?site=mmrjournal.biomedcentral.com)

Captain Marquet emphasizes the importance of refreshing our leader-follower model to keep up with the times. In our modern world, when the most important work that we do is cognitive, the leader-follower model results in sub-optimal work. What's the point in hiring people for their brainpower when we don't let them think for themselves?

Under Marquet's model, the key to a successful leader-leader culture is the delegation of **control**. As he states, *move the authority and decision-making to where the information is.*

Now of course, we will still end up with the same sub-optimal solutions if we delegate control without first ensuring that those whom we delegate to have the **competence** and **clarity** to make decisions that are in line with company values and performance expectations.

To drive improvements in competency across organizations, it is important to grow a culture of learning. "We learn!" became the new mantra of the USS Santa Fe when Marquet stepped in. Crew members who previously felt burnt out and on the verge of quitting began studying operational material and reading broadly in their own personal time. Retention soared to an all-time high. Marquet also emphasized the importance of taking deliberate action and of specifying goals- not methods- to encourage crew members to take their education and competency into their own hands.

Then, to ensure clarity among his crew members, Marquet defined the values of his ship day in and day out. He did so by repeating often, rewarding instantly, encouraging a questioning attitude, and building trust through taking care of his people. Through these actions, the crew members felt like they could approach Marquet and really internalize the values and direction of their organization. The clarity helped crew members not only in performing well, but also in making good decisions that were in line with the organizations goals and values.

With competence and clarity in place, Marquet felt confident in delegating control. To accomplish this, he resisted his own urge to provide solutions and encouraged crew members to state their intentions rather than to ask for permission.

A conversation abroad the USS Santa Fe would typically sound like this,
“Captain, I intend to submerge the ship. We are in water we own, water depth has been checked and is 400 feet, all men are below, the ship is rigged for dive, and I’ve certified my watch team.”
Marquet would then reply,
“Very well”
And off they would go.

Overall, I feel the book is worth a read/listen if you can make it past the beginning. Otherwise, perusing [Marquet's Intent Based Leadership model](http://www.davidmarquet.com) could do just as well.

An advice from the model is to promote mentor/mentor relationships rather than mentor/mentee relationships. I like that a lot-- as it highlights that everyone has knowledge to share that others don't, regardless of seniority.

Rating: 8/10
