#### **Book Review #16**
## Review
I impulsively bought this book before a five hour flight, so I didn't have too much expectation going in. **Everybody Lies: Big Data, New Data, and What the Internet Can Tell Us About Who We Really Are **basically summarizes Seth's research on Google search data. I say it's worth a read if you like trivia and understanding more about how people*** actually are*** *(what they search in private)* vs. who they ***say they are*** *(how they portray in public surveys)*. However, I'm not impressed by the presentation.

**The good**: Using google search data to learn about people is pretty clever. People are more unfiltered when searching on google than they would normally be answering formal surveys. And what Seth Stephens-Davidowitz finds is pretty eye-opening. It would seem our worst fears about the world are confirmed by google search data. A [frequency map](https://www.52-insights.com/news/seth-stephens-davidowitz-everybody-lies-google-data/) for the search term 'nigger' google correlates very well with areas where Trump won in the 2016 election... more so than any other traditional source. And although official data shows a reduction in child abuse during the Great Recession, [google searches](https://nkimberly.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/878e6-childabusepaper13.pdf) actually show a significant rise in child abuse rates, while reporting rates plummeted.

**The eh**: I honestly expected more focus on the data and analysis itself. Instead I got piles of conclusions drawn from google search data. And that would have been fine had the author also shown some of the analysis for these conclusions. I'm not disputing his conclusions, as I know he has them in [long form](http://sethsd.com/research/), but it's fairly boring to read a list conclusions without seeing the story of how those conclusions were reached. For me at least, that's the most exciting part.

If you don't have time to read the book but want to check out other interesting conclusions that Seth shares, then check this [article](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jul/09/everybody-lies-how-google-reveals-darkest-secrets-seth-stephens-davidowitz) out!
