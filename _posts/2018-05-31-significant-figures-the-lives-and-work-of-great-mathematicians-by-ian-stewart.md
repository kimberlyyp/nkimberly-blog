Ian Nicholas Stewart FRS is an Emeritus Professor of Mathematics at the University of Warwick, England, and widely known for engaging the public with mathematics and science through his many bestselling books, newspaper and magazine articles, and radio and television appearances. Ian’s accessible and entertaining style of writing has opened up a range of hard-to-fathom topics — including chaos theory and symmetry — to general audiences ([source](https://ianstewartjoat.weebly.com/biography.html)).

**Book Review #17**
## Review
After a string of mediocre reads, I am happy to have picked up this gem! This work covers not only the history of mathematicians but also the range of mathematics discovered throughout history.

As I made my way through this book, I started to see how broad and beautiful mathematics really is. I truly fell in love by the end. If it were Ian Stewart's intention to drive passion for mathematics and instill a curiosity in readers, then I am absolutely a success story.

The book itself is not as I initially expected. There is quite a bit of side gossip that our author brings in. These tangents had me simultaneously cringe and smile. Luckily he gets right back into the math fairly quickly :)

The book begins with the invention story of levers, pulleys, and water screws by our beloved Archimedes. Included are some entertaining stories about his intelligence and, to some degree, his ego. Presenting his invention of the lever, Archimedes writes to the King, "Give me a place to stand, and I will move the Earth."

Chapter 2 moves us to China, spotlighting the achievements of a Liu Hui, who made significant advancements in geometry and beyond. Perhaps my favorite moment in the book is the rendering of Hui's proof of Pythagoras's Theorem. I wish I had learned it this way when I was in middle school.

Here you can see the the triangle rendered as sides matching up to three other squares, whose constituents are divvied up to show that the sum area of the two smaller squares comprise of the same value as that of the largest square.

Muhammad al-Khwarizmi of Persia takes center stage in chapter 3, where I learned that 'Algorithms' came from his name. The inventor of algebra, al-Khwarizmi popularized the generalization of solving the algebraic equations we know today.

You'll find here that in order to arrive at the constant value of the root, we must 'complete' the square which coincides with the geometric value of these corners.

In chapter 4 we are introduced to Madhava, who made infinite series cool.** The infinite series of cosine and sine that we had longed attributed to Newton were actually discovered in India by Madhava nearly *four centuries* earlier.**

Chapters 5 and 6 are more gossip than math, but we get right back into it in Chapter 7, where Ian delves into the life and inventions of Isaac Newton. Apparently a mediocre kid, Newton went on to become a prolific inventor of mathematical physics. Although we've somewhat gone beyond Newtonian physics with quantum mechanics and relativity, the importance of his findings remain. Much of the world that we compute and predict on a daily basis would not be without Newton's system of the world.

We then *approach* Euler. He is far more amazing than I could have ever imagined. His intuition for developing formulas by seeing relationships among the most complex of concepts is inspirational. In his introduction to analysis of the infinite, Euler investigated exponential and trigonometric functions, identifying the beloved e^(i*pi) + 1 = 0 equation we all known and admire. As if he couldn't be more likeable, he would jump from topic to topic to avoid boredom and blazed trails in each field: number theory, graph theory, fluid mechanics, potential theory, wave theory, celestial mechanics, and logic.

Here you'll find the inspiration for Sudoku. The map of the seven bridges was (negatively) solved by Euler in his book, Solutio Problematis Ad Geometriam Situs Pertinentis. In studying this problem and defining it in a more abstract form, Euler laid the foundation for graph theory. Euler shows that the possibility of a walk through a graph, traversing each edge exactly once, depends on the degrees of the nodes. Euler's argument was that in order to pass through each bridge once and only once, the graph had to have exactly zero or two nodes of odd degree. In this problem, there are four nodes of odd degree, so there is no solution.

I'd love to recount every chapter, but I shouldn't spoil too much. Instead I'll point to** Fourier, Gauss, Boole, and Thurston** as my favorite succeeding chapters, so if anything, skip to those chapters! The Fourier and Gauss era is particularly relevant to chemical engineers. Then there's Boole, as in *booleans*, and Thurston for some great references to knot theory and higher dimensions.
