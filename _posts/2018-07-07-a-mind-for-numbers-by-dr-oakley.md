Barbara Oakley, PhD, PE is a Professor of Engineering at Oakland University in Rochester, Michigan; the Ramón y Cajal Distinguished Scholar of Global Digital Learning at McMaster University; and Coursera’s inaugural “Innovation Instructor.” Her work focuses on the complex relationship between neuroscience and social behavior. Dr. Oakley’s research has been described as “revolutionary” in the Wall Street Journal—she has published in outlets as varied as the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the Wall Street Journal, and The New York Times. She has won numerous teaching awards, including the American Society of Engineering Education’s Chester F. Carlson Award for technical innovation in engineering education ([source](https://www.coursera.org/instructor/barboakley)).

**Book Review #18**
## Review
Have you heard of the Einstellung effect? Or the concept of strengthening memory traces through context to create mental "chunks"?

Both concepts are fascinating and worthwhile to know if you're a competitive learner and would like to learn as efficiently as possible and be as productive with that knowledge as possible.

*A Mind for Numbers* disappointed me initially, since it isn't about mathematics, despite its title. As I continued through the book, however, I gained valuable lessons in the realm of memory and learning. By the end of it, I realized I wholeheartedly recommend this book.

## The Learning Process
When we first read a text on a topic we aren't familiar with, it can sometimes feel like looking down at a thousand piece puzzle arranged randomly. But, when armed with past knowledge that we've done this before, we roll up our sleeves and begin evaluating the pieces and rearranging them until a coherent image is formed.

Of course, as puzzles become progressively more difficult, increasing in dimension (rubix cubes), in complexity (new puzzle rules), in composition (fractal images), and in sheer quantity (more pieces), we require more time to solve them. In this extended time frame, we begin to doubt ourselves and feel discouraged.

If we are knowledgeable about how our memory, creativity, and learning process works – ***that they DO work – ***we can move past this discouragement and eventually accomplish the task at hand.

Unfortunately, few students have learned to harness the learning process and give up before they ever get to try. The author, Dr. Barbara Oakley, gave up on math as a kid, thinking she didn't have the mental faculties for it. She went from not being able to read an analog clock to becoming a professor of engineering, conducting research in bioengineering with emphasis on neuroscience and cognitive psychology.

The best audience for this book is, well, anyone. It is not for math flunkers or math geniuses in particular. The tools Dr. Oakley presents are ones that each of us sometimes ignore or even run counter to, in varying degrees. Obviously, some of us excel and math and sciences, but that doesn't mean excellent students won't gain from this book. It just means that their study habits often, whether noticed or not, capitalize on how memories are built, how focused mode plays well with intermittent diffuse modes, and how chunking can string disparate concepts leading to problem-solving that is not only faster but also leaves room for creativity in its solutions.

A couple of my favorite concepts and pieces of advice:
## I.    Leverage both Focus and Diffuse Modes
We toggle between focused and diffuse modes of thinking. The focused mode of thinking allows us to route memory but can often get in the way of problem-solving. The Einstellung effect is when we get stuck in one solution toward solving a problem that is wrong, but we can't get out of it because we are stuck in this focus mode of thinking that leaves no room for other pathways.

What research has found is that when we step away from a problem and allow for our diffuse mode of thinking, we allow for activity across our networks, tapping into other potential pathways that can lead us to the right solution. We would have never tapped into these distant corners of our neural network otherwise.

## II.    Don't Overfit and/or Underfit Our Learning
I've been reading another book called 'How to Create a Mind', and there is a concept of underfitting and overfitting our understanding of concepts. This relates nicely to Dr. Oakley's next piece of advice: when trying to commit concepts to memory, we want to be sure that we are not spending hours re-reading a problem or memorizing specific wording or, well, not spending much any time at all.

Rather, we want to both temporally and conceptually space out our evaluation of the problem. We should review a problem with breaks in between, and then we should make sure that our set of problems is broad enough that we aren't overfitting our understanding to just this particular wording/problem and confine ourselves to only being able to accurately solve these particular problems. Likewise, don't practice too few problems or problems too broad that we underfit our learning and end up using the same problem-solving methodology on wildly different problems.
## III.    Do Level Up and Chunk
Have you ever first approached a problem, followed the solution guide, and thought,
I will never remember how to solve this! There are so many steps, references, and calculations! And so many variables to keep track of!
Then, after about a week of working these problems, we find suddenly realize,
Oh, there's actually only three high-level steps, only two tables to reference from, and these variables tend to behave this way so I already have an idea of what they're going to do when I run my calculations.
That is chunking.

Chunking is abstracting up to the point that the low level details link up to a higher level concept which link up to an even higher level topology of problems and context. When information is chunked in this way, we can see a situation, instantly recognize it as a context for a particular type of problem-solving methodology, and then further down recognize the methodology's discrete components that allow us to solve the problem at hand.

By constantly changing mental gears from lower level arithmetic to the higher level context of a problem, we can start to build these abstractions that allow us to have a much broader and deeper understanding of what we are learning.

This chunking process requires both focus and diffuse modes. A good strategy is to leverage focus mode to extract information and some sample solutions from the text, then step away and try to summarize them. At first, we may find we come away with nothing. But repeat this process until we feel we come away with the full picture. Then read all of the assigned homework and practice exams but don't solve them. Now leverage diffuse thinking to allow our minds to wander about the problem without writing anything down or even thinking about the problems directly. Finally, focus and solve them. We will find more original solutions this way as well as learn more deeply.
Side note: Did you know that the pythagorean theorem has 367 different proofs?
