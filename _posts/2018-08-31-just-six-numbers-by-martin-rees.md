Martin John Rees, Baron Rees of Ludlow, OM, FRS, FREng, FMedSci, FRAS (born 23 June 1942) is a British cosmologist and astrophysicist. He has been Astronomer Royal since 1995 and was Master of Trinity College, Cambridge from 2004 to 2012 and President of the Royal Society between 2005 and 2010 (source).

Review
Consider this: when hydrogen fuses into helium, exactly 0.7% of the mass converts to energy. If that number were 0.6%, the strong force couldn't stabilize deuterium, and the universe would contain nothing but hydrogen. If it were 0.8%, all hydrogen would have been consumed in the early universe before stars had a chance to form. We exist in a narrow window.
This is the kind of knife-edge Rees explores in *Just Six Numbers*. His central claim is that six dimensionless constants govern the structure of our universe, and that if any were altered even slightly, the universe would not have permitted complex structures, or life, to develop. It's a genuine scientific puzzle that motivates serious research: multiverse theories, anthropic reasoning, and the search for deeper unified theories that might explain why these constants have the values they do.
He's got a bit of a dry tone that may take some time to adjust to, but like many physics texts, the narration grows more authentic and passionate as the topic becomes more complex.
As for the six numbers:
The first pair, N and epsilon, relate the basic forces present in the nucleus of an atom. The second pair, omega and lambda, describe the basic texture and size of the universe. Finally, the last pair, Q and D, fix the properties of space itself.
**I: N = 10^36** is the relative strength of electrostatic forces to gravity. Gravity is 10^36 times weaker than the electrostatic force.
If gravity were any stronger, galaxies would form more quickly and be more densely packed. With shorter stellar lifetimes at higher density, stars wouldn't be able to form the stable planetary systems we know of today.
**II: ε = 0.007** is the fraction of mass converted to energy when hydrogen fuses to helium, the efficiency of nuclear fusion. When four hydrogen nuclei fuse into helium, 0.7% of their mass becomes binding energy. This defines how firmly atomic nuclei bind together.
If this efficiency factor were smaller, the strong force would not be strong enough to stabilize protons and neutrons in the formation of deuterium, a requisite for the formation of helium. Our universe would be comprised solely of hydrogen, with no heavier elements.
On the other hand, if epsilon were higher, the strong force would overcome the electrical repulsion of protons and deplete all hydrogen in our universe before stars could form complex elements through stellar nucleosynthesis.
**III: Ω ≈ 1** is the ratio of the total energy density of the universe to the critical density needed for a flat universe. An omega of exactly 1 means the universe is geometrically flat, neither curved like a sphere nor like a saddle.
The puzzle is that ordinary visible matter contributes only about Ω ≈ 0.05. Dark matter adds roughly another Ω ≈ 0.25, bringing matter to about 0.3. The remaining 0.7 or so comes from dark energy. Together, these sum to approximately 1, giving us a flat universe. Why omega should be so close to 1 is one of cosmology's deep puzzles. Inflation theory offers one explanation.
What dark matter actually is remains one of cosmology's biggest mysteries. Rees predicted that we'd know by now. Unfortunately, we still don't.
**IV: Ω_Λ ≈ 0.7** is the density parameter for dark energy, the fraction of the universe's total energy density contributed by the cosmological constant. The cosmological constant Λ itself was originally introduced by Einstein as a fudge factor in his field equations so that their solutions would lead to a static universe. At the time, the consensus was that the universe was static. It was later found that solutions with this fudge factor were unstable and could not describe a static universe. That turned out to be fine, because our universe isn't static. The cosmological constant was reborn in 1998 when observations of distant supernovae revealed that the universe's expansion is accelerating.
If lambda were too high, it would not allow galaxies to form, as the universe would have expanded far too quickly in its early days.
**V: Q = 1/100,000** is the amplitude of primordial density fluctuations, roughly the ratio of the gravitational energy of cosmic structures to their rest mass energy.
A low Q value (which we have) allows for a relatively homogeneous universe with structure forming gradually. A high Q value would imply dense aggregates, likely leading to the formation of many black holes and not much else.
**VI: D = 3** is the number of spatial dimensions on which gravity and electromagnetic forces act. This sounds like a given, but if we didn't have exactly three spatial dimensions, we wouldn't have the inverse-square law. If you drew the force lines from a charge or a mass, you'd find that at a distance r, the lines spread over an area of 4πr², the surface area of a sphere.
In a four-dimensional universe, we'd have an inverse-cube law, which would make orbits unstable. Planets would either spiral into the sun or escape to infinity with the slightest perturbation.
