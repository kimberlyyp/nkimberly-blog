Martin John Rees, Baron Rees of Ludlow, OM, FRS, FREng, FMedSci, FRAS (born 23 June 1942) is a British cosmologist and astrophysicist. He has been Astronomer Royal since 1995 and was Master of Trinity College, Cambridge from 2004 to 2012 and President of the Royal Society between 2005 and 2010 (source).

Review
Consider this: when hydrogen fuses into helium, exactly 0.7% of the mass converts to energy. If the strong nuclear force were slightly weaker (about 0.5%), deuterium would be unstable and the universe would contain nothing but hydrogen. If it were a few percent stronger, runaway fusion in the early universe would have consumed all hydrogen before stars could form. We exist in a narrow window.
This is the kind of knife-edge Rees explores in _Just Six Numbers_. His central claim is that six dimensionless constants govern the structure of our universe, and that if any were altered even slightly, the universe would not have permitted complex structures, or life, to develop. It's a genuine scientific puzzle that motivates serious research: multiverse theories, anthropic reasoning, and the search for deeper unified theories that might explain why these constants have the values they do.
He's got a bit of a dry tone that may take some time to adjust to, but like many physics texts, the narration grows more authentic and passionate as the topic becomes more complex.
As for the six numbers:
The first pair, N and epsilon, relate the basic forces present in the nucleus of an atom. The second pair, omega and lambda, describe the basic texture and size of the universe. Finally, the last pair, Q and D, fix the properties of space itself.
**I: N = 10^36** is the relative strength of electrostatic forces to gravity. Gravity is 10^36 times weaker than the electrostatic force.
If gravity were any stronger, galaxies would form more quickly and be more densely packed. With shorter stellar lifetimes at higher density, stars wouldn't be able to form the stable planetary systems we know of today.
**II: ε = 0.007** is the fraction of mass converted to energy when hydrogen fuses to helium, the efficiency of nuclear fusion. When four hydrogen nuclei fuse into helium, 0.7% of their mass becomes binding energy. This defines how firmly atomic nuclei bind together.
If the strong nuclear force were about 0.5% weaker, deuterium would be unstable and no complex nuclei could form. Our universe would be comprised solely of hydrogen, with no heavier elements.
On the other hand, if the strong force were a few percent stronger, diprotons (helium-2) might become stable, leading to runaway fusion in the early universe that would consume all hydrogen before stars could form complex elements through stellar nucleosynthesis.
**III: Ω ≈ 1** is the ratio of the total energy density of the universe to the critical density needed for a flat universe. An omega of exactly 1 means the universe is geometrically flat, neither curved like a sphere nor like a saddle.
The puzzle is that ordinary visible matter contributes only about Ω ≈ 0.05. Dark matter adds roughly another Ω ≈ 0.25, bringing matter to about 0.3. The remaining 0.7 or so comes from dark energy. Together, these sum to approximately 1, giving us a flat universe. Why omega should be so close to 1 is one of cosmology's deep puzzles. Inflation theory offers one explanation.
What dark matter actually is remains one of cosmology's biggest mysteries. Rees predicted that we'd know by now. Unfortunately, we still don't.
**IV: Ω_Λ ≈ 0.7** is the density parameter for dark energy, the fraction of the universe's total energy density contributed by the cosmological constant. The cosmological constant Λ itself was originally introduced by Einstein in 1917 as a fudge factor in his field equations so that their solutions would lead to a static universe. At the time, the consensus was that the universe was static. Einstein abandoned it by 1931 after Hubble's discovery of cosmic expansion, reportedly calling it his "biggest blunder"—though historians note this quote is apocryphal and poorly documented. The cosmological constant was reborn in 1998 when observations of distant supernovae revealed that the universe's expansion is accelerating.
If lambda were too high, it would not allow galaxies to form, as the universe would have expanded far too quickly in its early days.
**V: Q = 1/100,000** is the amplitude of primordial density fluctuations, roughly the ratio of the gravitational energy of cosmic structures to their rest mass energy.
A low Q value (which we have) allows for a relatively homogeneous universe with structure forming gradually. A high Q value would imply dense aggregates, likely leading to the formation of many black holes and not much else.
**VI: D = 3** is the number of spatial dimensions on which gravity and electromagnetic forces act. This sounds like a given, but if we didn't have exactly three spatial dimensions, we wouldn't have the inverse-square law. If you drew the force lines from a charge or a mass, you'd find that at a distance r, the lines spread over an area of 4πr², the surface area of a sphere.
In more than three spatial dimensions, inverse-power-law forces steeper than r^-2 don't support stable closed orbits. Planets would either spiral into the sun or escape to infinity with the slightest perturbation. In fewer dimensions, while orbits might exist mathematically, the physics would be too constraining for the complex structures needed for life.
