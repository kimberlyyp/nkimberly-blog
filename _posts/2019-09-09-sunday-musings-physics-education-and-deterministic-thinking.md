I've noticed a pattern in conversations about quantum field theory with non-physicists. Some people engage with the ideas and find them fascinating. Others dismiss them outright as "unscientific" because they violate their intuitions about how science should work—specifically, that science must be deterministic and reductionist to be legitimate.
This isn't a fluke of my social circle. While my sample is limited (maybe two dozen such conversations over the years, mostly in casual settings), the pattern is consistent enough to make me wonder: **Is there something about how we teach physics in high school that reinforces deterministic thinking as the only "scientific" worldview?**
Most Americans encounter physics only in high school, where the curriculum centers on Newtonian mechanics. This makes pedagogical sense—Newtonian physics is mathematically tractable at the high school level, applies to everyday experience, and provides a foundation for more advanced study.
But here's my concern: **Newtonian mechanics, taught without adequate caveats, can leave students with the impression that:**

All phenomena have simple cause-and-effect explanations
Outcomes are absolutely predictable given sufficient information
The universe operates like clockwork
Anything that doesn't fit this model is "unscientific"

This wouldn't matter if most students went on to study quantum mechanics or chaos theory. But they don't. For the majority, high school physics is their last formal exposure to the subject. The worldview they form there persists.
The problem isn't that people think Newtonian mechanics is useful—it is! The problem is when they think it's _complete_, and that probabilistic or systems-based approaches are somehow less rigorous.
Ironically, even within classical mechanics, the three-body problem and chaos theory show that "predictable in principle" doesn't mean "predictable in practice." But these nuances are rarely taught alongside Newton's laws.
This has implications beyond physics. Understanding emergent phenomena—whether in climate systems, economics, or ecosystem dynamics—requires comfort with:

Statistical and systems-based thinking rather than simple deterministic causation
Emergent properties that arise from interactions but aren't predictable from individual components alone
Systems where small changes can have large, unpredictable effects

If your mental model of "how science works" is locked into Newtonian determinism, you're poorly equipped for these domains.
Now I don't have a fully-formed solution, but here are some possibilities:
**1. Explicit caveats in Newtonian mechanics courses**

"This is an approximation, excellent for everyday scales and speeds"
"It fails at subatomic scales (quantum mechanics) and relativistic velocities (relativity)"
"Even within its domain, deterministic systems can be unpredictable (chaos theory)"

**2. Earlier introduction to quantum concepts** Not full QFT—that's unrealistic. But even qualitative exposure to:

Wave-particle duality
The measurement problem and different interpretations of quantum mechanics
Fundamental indeterminism (distinct from chaos theory's practical unpredictability)
How well-tested quantum mechanics is—it underlies all modern electronics and has been verified to extraordinary precision

Note that chaos theory and quantum mechanics represent different types of unpredictability: chaos emerges from deterministic equations with extreme sensitivity to initial conditions, while quantum mechanics (in standard interpretations) involves true fundamental randomness. Both challenge naive determinism, but in different ways.

**3. More emphasis on models as approximations** Physics education should emphasize that **all models are approximations**. Newtonian mechanics isn't "wrong"—it's incredibly useful within its domain. But it's not complete. This is true of all scientific models.
The world might benefit from physics education that emphasizes models as useful approximations rather than absolute truths. We need students who can think probabilistically, who understand emergent complexity, and who don't equate "scientific" with "deterministic."
Whether my proposed fixes would work is an open question. But the problem—people dismissing legitimate science because it violates their deterministic priors—seems real enough to warrant attention.
In the meantime, I should probably stop debating physics with strangers at bars.
